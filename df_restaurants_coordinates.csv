Lucia,via Lampedusa 12,Giulianova Lido,64021,Italy,€€,"Seafood,ClassicCuisine","Having just celebrated their 50th anniversary (they opened in 1971), this restaurant and hotel of the same name remain a solid culinary reference on the Abruzzi coast. The menu here is dedicated solely to fish and, as a result and is often the case, the wine list focuses almost exclusively on white wines. The fish (almost all of which comes from the Adriatic) is carefully sourced, while in the kitchen the chefs prepare classic dishes (such as enormous local langoustines cooked – and served – in a pan with oil, wine, garlic and rosemary) and a few more modern recipes (crispy mullet served with the award-winning spicy Ventricina salami).",['Air conditioning'],"['Amex', 'Maestrocard', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']",+39 085 800 5807,https://www.hlucia.it/,Abruzzo,42.7506,13.9652

The Italian cuisine served here is prepared simply, allowing the quality of the ingredients (many of which are sourced locally) to shine through. Fish from the lake takes pride of place, although saltwater fish also features.
