It now offers 100% gluten-free recipes, including a few vegan options, without compromising in any way on the quality or beautiful presentation of the dishes featured on its well-constructed menu. Friendly, attentive service and summer outdoor dining in the pedestrianised area add to the appeal.	Air conditioning, Terrace	Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 041 611905
