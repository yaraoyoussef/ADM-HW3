Osteria La Torre	via dell'Ospedale 22	Cherasco	12062	Italy	€€	Piedmontese	To get to this welcoming restaurant, it’s best to leave the car in one of the convenient car parks just outside the town walls a short walk from Cherasco’s quiet, picturesque historic centre with its two perpendicular streets. At Osteria La Torre, the friendly female staff will happily guide you through the menu, which features traditional dishes prepared in contemporary style – we particularly enjoyed the egg, cardoon and fondue dish, followed by breaded veal rump as our main course. If you’re a fan of snails, you really must try them here as Cherasco is renowned for this speciality. The extensive wine list demonstrates the same high quality as the cuisine.
