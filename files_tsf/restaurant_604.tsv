Al Bersagliere	via Dietro Pallone 1	Verona	37121	Italy	€	Venetian,TraditionalCuisine	This long-established restaurant in the Borgo Filippi district overflows with memorabilia (from the juke box to the old coffee machine dating from the 1960s) and owes its continued success to its generous, comforting cuisine that showcases the fine traditions of the Veneto. Specialities include bigoli pasta with duck,pastissada de caval(horsemeat stew) andgelato spiritoso(ice cream flavoured with grappa). Guests can visit the interesting wine cellar, parts of which date back to the early 13C, which focuses on labels from the Verona region (especially Amarone). There’s also an excellent selection of spirits.	Air conditioning, Interesting wine list, Terrace	Mastercard, Visa	+39 045 800 4824
