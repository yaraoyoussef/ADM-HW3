Contrada	località Monastero d'Ombrone 19	Castelnuovo Berardenga	53019	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,Tuscan	In the charming setting of an old hamlet, chef Davide Canella, who has plenty of experience behind him, serves delicious, elegant cuisine presented on a tasting menu and an à la carte on which meat takes centre stage (although a few fish options also feature). Dishes include exquisite prawns and panzanella, and duck breast served with hosomaki. Manuela, the friendly, professional sommelier, oversees the front of house, offering excellent recommendations on the best wine pairings. In other words, a delightful all-round dining experience thanks to the competence and enthusiasm of all involved.	Air conditioning, Car park, Garden or park	Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 0577 570570
