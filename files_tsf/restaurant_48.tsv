Due Colombe	via Foresti 13	Borgonato	25040	Italy	€€€	Countrycooking,Creative	At this restaurant, the chef’s highly creative approach does not ignore his culinary roots, resulting in a successful reinterpretation of local peasant traditions and top-quality cuisine. Our inspectors highly recommended making your way to this thousand-year-old hamlet, where you dine in a deconsecrated church under a brick-vaulted ceiling. The fine cuisine celebrated here includes historic dishes that have become classic favourites, which can be chosen from the three tasting menus. A good example is the beef cooked with olive oil and served with polenta: “Nonna” Elvira made this dish in the post-war period and her grandson Stefano follows the same recipe today. The menu also includes a few fish dishes, while wine-enthusiasts shouldn’t hesitate to ask sommelier Federica for her recommendations – they won’t regret it!
