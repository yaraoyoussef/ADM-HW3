Abraxas Osteria	via Scalandrone 15	località Lucrino	Pozzuoli	80078	€€	Campanian	Situated inland at a slightly higher altitude than the coast, this restaurant on two floors focuses all its attention on its regional cuisine and its wine list. Very good value for money, although you will spend a bit more (and it’s worth it! ) if you choose one of the grilled meat options.
