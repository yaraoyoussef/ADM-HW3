Il Cappero	via Vulcanello	Isola Vulcano	98055	Italy	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine,ModernCuisine	The change of chef at this restaurant is echoed by the excellent level of cuisine on offer here. Young Onofrio Pagnotto, who was already sous-chef at the resort’s Tenerumi restaurant and who is supported by the hotel’s executive chef Davide Guidara, offers two tasting menus (one shorter than the other). Both menus showcase local ingredients prepared with technical expertise to create contemporary, Mediterranean dishes that are full of flavour. Onofrio is not afraid to use the occasional French sauce, as well as his beloved fermentations in his dishes. As a final flourish, the desserts come courtesy of Gianluca Colucci, the pastry chef shared with Tenerumi. After enjoying a first, delicious dessert in the dining room, guests move to the “pasticceria” corner where pastry chefs “improvise” a final dessert in line with guests’ preferences. Last but not least, the restaurant boasts a superb setting within the Therasia Resort perched on the Vulcanello promontory above the sea, with breathtaking views of the Aeolian islands often enhanced by blazing sunsets.
