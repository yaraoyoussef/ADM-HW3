Gardenia	corso Torino 9	Caluso	10014	Italy	€€€	Piedmontese,ModernCuisine	Even if you’re not a local, you’ll feel at home in this old property which offers a glimpse of the Piedmont of old. In this 19C building, with a typical balcony running along the inner courtyard, the atmosphere continues into the dining room and, of course, via the dishes on the menu. Here, regional cuisine is celebrated to the full, so you’ll find lots of meat (although some fish options are also available), accompanied by a carefully selected choice of vegetables, some grown in the restaurant’s own garden.
