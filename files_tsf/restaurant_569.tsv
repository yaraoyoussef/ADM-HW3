Già Sotto l'Arco	corso Vittorio Emanuele 71	Carovigno	72012	Italy	€€€€	Italian,Creative	A historic name among Puglia’s Michelin-starred restaurants, this refined property has an equally historic setting on the first floor of a Baroque palazzo in an elegant piazza. A fine staircase leads up to the simple yet stylish dining room which is typically Puglian in feel and which is skilfully run by a father and daughter team, occasionally assisted by the son when his medical studies allow. Delicious meat and fish dishes feature on the menu, prepared by the chef using regional ingredients alongside produce from further afield, weaving it all together in a style of cuisine that is creatively Italian. Excellent choice of wine, thanks to the owner’s passion for and involvement in wine (and olive oil) production over the past few years. There’s also an intriguing selection of spirits.
