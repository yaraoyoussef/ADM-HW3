Quadri Bistrot	Via Solferino 48	Milan	20121	Italy	€€	ModernCuisine,Contemporary	A modern bistro with a cocktail-bar, trendy decor, soft lighting and lounge-style background music, as well as a small outdoor space on the pavement which needs to be booked well in advance. The imaginative cuisine comes courtesy of a talented chef who creates dishes full of character from top-quality seasonal ingredients. Our inspectors particularly enjoyed the Bresse chicken stuffed with a cherry sauce.	Air conditioning, Terrace, Wheelchair access	Amex, Maestrocard, Mastercard, Visa	+39 02 4775 5505
