Marixx	Passeggiata Marconi 5	Ventimiglia	18039	Italy	€€€	Seafood,SeasonalCuisine	Located well away from the busy city centre and overlooking the luxury yachts and boats moored in the harbour, this restaurant opened in the summer of 2021, at the same time as the modern Cala del Forte marina in which it is situated (the name of the marina comes from the Forte dell'Annunziata, the ruins of which are visible from the side facing the sea). Fish and seafood take pride of place here (especially raw fish dishes), served with classic, seasonal accompaniments, as well as snacks, while an oyster bar is an added attraction. Although the best tables are in the glass-fronted veranda overlooking the pedestrian promenade, the contemporary-style dining room is also attractive. The owner-chef has plenty of experience behind him, especially working in the region.	Air conditioning, Terrace	Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 0184 840483
