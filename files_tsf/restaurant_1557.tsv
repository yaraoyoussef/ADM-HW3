Palazzaccio	via Umberto I 23	Castelbuono	90013	Italy	€€	Sicilian,Countrycooking	A simple, almost rustic restaurant in the pedestrianised historic centre of one of the medieval villages that add to the special attraction of the Parco delle Madonie. Here, the owner prepares seasonal cuisine which is firmly anchored in the region, made from ingredients from the surrounding area. The antipasto is always good, and is served as a selection of five or six small bites made from vegetables, cheese and meat, as well as mushrooms. The home-made bread is excellent – the natural leavening process takes almost four days. A good wine selection completes the picture.
