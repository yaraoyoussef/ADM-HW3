Casin del Gamba	via Roccolo Pizzati 1	Altissimo	36070	Italy	€€€€	Countrycooking,ModernCuisine	The journey to get here – a winding road through woods and hills – may be challenging at times but the warm welcome offered by the whole family Dal Lago at this delightful restaurant makes you feel completely at home and more than compensates for the effort. Owner-chef Antonio shares the honours and duties of his role with long-established sous-chef Biolo. Together, they prepare cuisine that is perfectly balanced between classic flavours and modern trends, using local ingredients that respect the passing seasons. Game features on the menu in winter, while dishes are often seasoned with wild aromatic herbs (for example, the local snails served with thyme and onion bread). For her part, Signora Daria determinedly takes on two roles: she not only prepares the desserts, but also skilfully supervises front of house, ably assisted by son Luca who is happy to advise guests on their choice of wine. The well-structured wine list also includes a good number of organic wines.
