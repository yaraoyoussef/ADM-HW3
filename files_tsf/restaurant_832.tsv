Impronta d'Acqua	via Aurelia 2121	Cavi di Lavagna	16030	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary,Creative	Situated on the straight road skirting the seafront and the railway line, this open-plan restaurant has a minimalist, contemporary feel with an open-view kitchen to the rear. Here, you’ll catch glimpses of owner-chef Ivan Maniago and his team at work as they use skilful techniques to prepare their four tasting menus (all the dishes can also be chosen à la carte style if you prefer). One of the menus is dedicated to vegetarian dishes; two focus on fish and meat options (the unique dish featuring pigeon breast made into a terrine with pistachios and fried pigeon leg deserves a special mention); while the fourth focuses on traditional offal (“quinto quarto”) dishes.
