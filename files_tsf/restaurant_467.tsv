Idylio by Apreda	Piazza dei Caprettari	56/60	Rome	00186	€€€€	ItalianContemporary	Situated in a quiet street in the centre of Rome, this modern, trendy restaurant is part of the Pantheon Hotel. Talented chef Francesco Apreda from Campania is at the helm in the kitchen, where he adds spices and Asian touches to his Neapolitan-influenced cuisine. There’s no longer an à la carte here, as the focus is on three tasting menus: Firma Iconica, Sapidità Essenziali and Idylio's Butterfly (the latter allows guests to choose four courses from the other two menus). The young, efficient serving staff are full of smiles and more than happy to assist you as you choose from Apreda’s often personalised menus.
