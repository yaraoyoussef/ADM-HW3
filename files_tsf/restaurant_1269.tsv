Da Guido	via Roma Sinistra 25	Jesolo	30016	Italy	€€€	Seafood	The story of this restaurant began in 1967, when Guido and Giovanna Fasan, both of whom still work front of house, met in Germany. They then moved back to Italy, where they opened Da Guido in the early 1990s. White dominates in the elegant, contemporary-style dining room, while the cuisine features delicious seafood dishes with a focus on grilled specialities. In summer, there’s a welcoming bar in the garden, which boasts a romantic atmosphere. Together with other restaurant-owners from Venice, the Fasan family also have a kitchen garden on the Venetian island of Sant’Erasmo, where they focus on sustainable growing methods.
