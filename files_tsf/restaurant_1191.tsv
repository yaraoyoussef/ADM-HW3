Lazzaro 1915	via Roma 351	Pontelongo	35029	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary,Creative	Although it is now home to a welcoming and contemporary family restaurant, this building was once used as a place to rest horses and provide hospitality to workers from the sugar factory opposite. Daniela Siviero oversees the front of house with charm and professionalism, while her brother Piergiorgio is at the helm in the kitchen. The restaurant serves two tasting menus: “DNA”, an 8-course menu showcasing technically creative cuisine that focuses on regional fish and meat options prepared in different ways, and the 4-course “Campagna Liquida” which changes weekly and on which vegetables take pride of place. Daniela will recommend the best wine pairing from a well-structured wine list that includes some real gems.
