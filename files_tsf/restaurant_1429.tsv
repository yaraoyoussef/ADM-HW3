Del Cambio	piazza Carignano 2	Turin	10123	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary	Del Cambio, Turin’s historic restaurant par excellence, is Piedmont’s crowning jewel, with few equals in the whole of Europe. Here, the meticulously restored Risorgimento room, with origins that back to the 18C, features a decor and furnishings that are almost entirely from the 19C. The creaking parquet flooring, also original, accompanies your entry into this historic setting: Cavour had his own window table here to watch over the Palazzo Carignano, the first parliament of the newly united Italy. Another room (Pistoletto), simpler and more informal in feel, can be found behind its more historic sibling. Although Matteo Baronetto’s cuisine takes inspiration from the past with some regionally inspired dishes, he also creates more imaginative and original fare. In addition to wines by the glass, the extraordinary wine list will delight wine-buffs, especially with its choice of Barolo and Barbaresco labels.
