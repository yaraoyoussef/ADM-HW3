The à la carte features specialities such as local cheeses, cured hams and meat dishes (including the region’s renownedarrosticini– skewered grilled meat), as well as traditional home-made pastas, each of which has its own name. The small wine list focuses on the region, with labels from across the province. Booking in advance is recommended.		Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 0864 69123
