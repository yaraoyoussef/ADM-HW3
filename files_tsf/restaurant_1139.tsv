Stefano Mocellin al Padovanino	via Santa Chiara 1	Padua	35123	Italy	€€€	Creative,ItalianContemporary	Situated in the historic centre of Padova, this restaurant is home to owner-chef Stefano Mocellin, whose colourful, creative and personalised cuisine is influenced by his past culinary experience in cities such as Milan and Venice. From Milan, for example, he has taken the legendary “cassoeula”, to which he gives a lighter touch thanks to his use of more than one type of meat (pork and duck), while his “saor” and the sardines that he uses to stuff his plin pasta are inspired by Venice. Underlying all of this is his passion for cooking over the barbecue grill, the main focus of almost all the dishes on the menu.	Air conditioning, Terrace	Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 375 619 7434
