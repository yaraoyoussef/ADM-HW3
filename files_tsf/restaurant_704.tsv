Antica Osteria Nonna Rosa	via Laudano 1	loc. Pietrapiana	Vico Equense	80069	€€€€	Campanian,Creative	The dining room at this restaurant has the warm ambience of an old country house, where two small niches with their own tables are perfect for a more private and romantic dinner. The decor includes dove-coloured walls, an array of lamps and even a typical nativity scene in which the chef and his mother (“Nonna Rosa”) make an appearance. The cuisine is original and creative with its roots in local traditions, and is prepared using ingredients from Campania and the restaurant’s own kitchen garden. Some years ago, owner-chef Giuseppe Guida purchased a large garden where he now grows all the vegetables used in his dishes. The restaurant describes its cuisine as “An exciting discovery of flavours from bygone days, with imaginative touches that are fully respectful of local traditions.”.
