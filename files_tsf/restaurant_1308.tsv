Cucina Cereda	via Piazzini 33	Ponte San Pietro	24036	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine	A typical entrance leads into the courtyard of what was a monastery in the late 16C at this restaurant, where the dining room has a classic atmosphere. However, it is the cuisine that steals the show – it is creative, yet down-to-earth with no unnecessary frills, full of flavour, and features meat and fish dishes inspired by Italian traditions with the occasional local twist. There’s a simpler, business-style menu at lunchtime, while among the à la carte options we particularly enjoyed the snails served with morel mushrooms and a careful seasoning of parsley and coriander, and the paccheri pasta with fish soup in which the bouillabaisse-style sauce added a real Mediterranean flavour.
