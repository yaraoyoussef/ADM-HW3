Osteria da Cippi	Borgo Valdestali 5	Frisanco	33080	Italy	€€	TraditionalCuisine,Italian	We particularly enjoyed this restaurant for its out-of-this-world feel. Housed in a charming chalet with an open fireplace, Osteria da Cippi serves cuisine made from typical local ingredients. At the helm in the kitchen, Nazzarena Del Fabbro is inspired by the seasons, using wild herbs from Valdestali in spring, vegetables from the restaurant’s small kitchen garden in summer, and seasonal fruit from the surrounding forests in autumn. Make sure you try the cjarsons. Guests are required to book in advance.		Mastercard, Visa	+39 340 151 2867
