Although the lunch menu is simple in style, it is still inspired by fresh fish and seafood, while in the evening the young yet experienced chef creates more imaginative and inventive fare. There’s a convenient private car park nearby: if you want to take advantage of this, make sure you advise the restaurant of your arrival time.
