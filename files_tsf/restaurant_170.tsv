Brezza fish and chill	Via Marina 24	Soverato	88068	Italy	€	Seafood,FishandChips	An alternative eatery amid the Abruzzo dining options, situated on the beautiful seafront promenade at Soverato. The idea is simple: fish takes centre stage, served in rolls, on "broast" and “friselle” bread, as well as raw or fried, although generous salads and delicious desserts are also available. The ingredients, full of flavour and always simply prepared, result in copious and colourful dishes. Good quality wine is available by the glass, plus a fine choice of cocktails which is enhanced in the evening by the addition of creative home-made options. Friendly female staff, plus excellent background music. A pleasant address serving quality food at very reasonable prices!	Air conditioning, Terrace	Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 0967 620802
