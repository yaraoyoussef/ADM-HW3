Scannabue Caffè Restaurant	largo Saluzzo 25/h	Turin	10125	Italy	€	Countrycooking	This local restaurant is decorated in vintage style with books, furnishings and decor all evoking the early 20C. The cuisine is regional in flavour and includes some surprising technical touches – the “vasocottura” rabbit tuna (cooked in a jar) is superb, while the beef cheek with mashed potato is served with an intensely flavoured gravy. Top-quality, authentic cuisine.	Air conditioning, Terrace	Mastercard, Visa	+39 011 669 6693
