Gellius	calle Pretoria 6	Oderzo	31046	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine	Gellius boasts a unique and atmospheric setting within the Antica Opitergium museum, surrounded by archaeological remains that tell the story of the town from the beginning of the Roman period. It’s just a short hop from this historic past to the present day, where chef Alessandro Breda moves away from the culinary traditions of the region to create imaginative dishes using ingredients from his surrounding area and the Adriatic Sea. If you’re looking for a state-of-the-art cocktail or a glass of good wine, make your way to the Lounge Bar, which looks out over Piazza Grande.
