Osteria de' Mercati	via Mercato 2	Sassari	07100	Italy	€€	MediterraneanCuisine,SeasonalCuisine	Slightly set back from the bustling streets of the historic centre yet still in the heart of the town, this delightful small restaurant is a recent addition to Sassari. It boasts a modern, elegant decor, friendly staff and a menu featuring carefully prepared fresh, seasonal dishes. Our inspector particularly recommends the seafood risotto. A choice of regional wines completes the picture.	Air conditioning	Amex, Dinersclub, Mastercard, Visa	+39 079 207 4486
