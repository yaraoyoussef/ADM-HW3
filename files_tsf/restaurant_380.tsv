Trattoria Antichi Sapori	via Montanara 318	Gaione	43124	Italy	â‚¬	Emilian,TraditionalCuisine	Just a few kilometres outside the town and yet already in open countryside, this typical local trattoria offers a simple yet warm and friendly ambience and excellent cuisine focused on regional specialities. The stuffed pasta and veal brisket are two of the dishes that we enjoyed the most here.	Air conditioning, Car park, Terrace	Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 0521 648165
