Guidoristorante	via Alba 15	Serralunga d'Alba	12050	Italy	€€€	Piedmontese,Contemporary	Lidia and Guido Alciati opened their restaurant in 1961 and Italian cuisine has not been the same since – their hard work signalled the beginning of real change which revolutionised cooking in Italy. They were among the first to understand the importance of regional ingredients, sourcing excellent produce which Lidia then showcased in her superb dishes, while Guido was responsible for the attentive service and excellent wine list. Their teachings live on in the sumptuous dining rooms in Villa Fontanafredda, where their children continue the culinary traditions established by their parents. Ugo’s sensitive skills in the kitchen and Piero’s experience front of house contribute to the success of this restaurant, where the best food and wine from the region in served in deceptively simple dishes that have few equals. One of the highlights is the plin (stuffed agnolotti pasta closed with a “pinch” by Lidia), which has drawn visitors here from all around the world and which is as delicious as ever – the pasta is stuffed with meat and vegetables and served with a velvety meat sauce. A modern fireplace adds a contemporary feel to the austere, old-fashioned elegance in one of the dining rooms.
