Otto Geleng	via Teatro Greco 59	Taormina	98039	Italy	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine,Sicilian	The elegant atmosphere at this restaurant is typical of Taormina and of Sicily’s old villas. It offers just eight tables laid out on a terrace adorned with bougainvillea and overlooking Taormina, the Bay of Naxos and Etna. The decor here shows real attention to detail, with an emphasis on the splendour of a grand old residence. To this backdrop, chef Roberto Toro creates typical Sicilian dishes reinterpreted with his own personal twist, and where a modern take on tradition and top-quality local ingredients are to the fore. More than 400 different wines are available to accompany this gourmet journey, with a choice of regional, Italian and French labels, including several excellent wines from small local wineries.
