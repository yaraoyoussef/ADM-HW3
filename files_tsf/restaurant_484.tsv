Antica Trattoria La Toppa	via del Giglio 43	San Donato in Poggio	50028	Italy	€	Tuscan	The two traditional rooms at this restaurant are perfectly in keeping with the medieval atmosphere of the beautifully preserved village of San Donato. The cuisine is obviously Tuscan in style, delighting guests with its exquisite home-made pasta expertly prepared by young chef Matteo. At certain times of the year, special dishes such as game make an appearance on the menu – the wild boar stew is not to be missed! Among the desserts, make sure you try the caramel panna cotta which is one of the best in the region. The small wine list includes a few labels from famous wineries.
