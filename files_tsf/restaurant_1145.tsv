Casamatta	contrada Scrasciosa	Manduria	74024	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine,Creative	Just a few kilometres outside Manduria, the capital of primitive wine, this restaurant is part of the Vinilia Wine Resort, which occupies an imposing early-20C castle surrounded by splendid grounds planted with mature olive trees. The restaurant is the jewel in the crown of this fine hotel, with its bright, airy dining room and large windows offering views of its outdoor dining space (highly recommended in fine weather). The furnishings are modern in design and the cleverly arranged lighting adds to the charm of the setting. With plenty of experience at leading restaurants behind him, chef Pietro Penna has returned home to his native region, to which he pays tribute in his cuisine. He makes full use of locally sourced produce, often using fruit and vegetables grown in the restaurant’s own kitchen garden in his modern and imaginative dishes. Three tasting menus are available, one of which is entirely vegetarian.
