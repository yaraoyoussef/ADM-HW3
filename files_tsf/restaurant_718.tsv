Ronchi Rò	località Cime di Dolegna 12	Dolegna del Collio	34070	Italy	€€	RegionalCuisine,Countrycooking	Ronchi Rò is an estate-cum-agriturismo surrounded by the verdant rolling hills and lush woodland of the Collio, a fascinating and enchanting border region famous for its superb wines. Chef Fares Issa’s cuisine is authentic, full of flavour and resolutely seasonal. Although his dishes are influenced by the culinary traditions of the Friuli region, including hams and salamis, goose speck and “frico” (a cheese and potato dish), he also includes the occasional contemporary twist. This is a small and intimate restaurant with just six tables in its attractive, modern dining room, so booking ahead is advisable!
