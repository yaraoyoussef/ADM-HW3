Oasis - Sapori Antichi	via Provinciale 8/10	Vallesaccarda	83050	Italy	€€€	Campanian,Contemporary	Run by the Fischetti family, this gastronomic oasis has been a stronghold for fine cuisine and regional flavours for 35 years now. The restaurant was opened in 1988, a year that is celebrated on the first page of the wine list with an extensive selection of fine labels from that year and also in the ricotta ravioli with walnut and seared garlic created by the restaurant’s founder – a dish still on the menu today. Now, as in the past, it is the women of the family who are at the helm in the kitchen: Michelina Fischetti and her granddaughter Serena Falco continue to conjure up delicious cuisine full of flavour which is prepared using carefully chosen ingredients (mostly organic) from the region with a focus on the passing seasons. The intention here is to create recipes that are open to new food trends and influences, while remaining faithful to a simple style of cuisine that is clean, ethical and inspired by traditional dishes from bygone days. Front of house, the friendly brothers of the family look after guests and oversee the courteous and attentive serving staff.
