Indigeno	Via di Villa Bianca 15	Montepulciano	53045	Italy	€€	TraditionalCuisine,Tuscan	Boasting an unusually beautiful setting within the Salcheto Organic Winery amid the rolling hills around Montepulciano, this 13C farmhouse has been converted into a wine estate that also includes a restaurant. Simple, home-style cooking with a focus on local traditions takes pride of place here, with dishes made from ingredients either produced on the estate itself or sourced from small-scale local producers. Guests sit at large shared tables made from Amiata oak, or outdoors in summer, where they can enjoy home-made bread and numerous other specialities, including bread gnocchetti with creamed broad beans and bitter herbs, and roast goose leg.
