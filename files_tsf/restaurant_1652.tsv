Il Piastrino	via Parco Begni 7	Pennabilli	47864	Italy	€€€	Countrycooking,Creative	The home of Claudia and Riccardo, Il Piastrino is situated amid the beautiful Montefeltro hills. A long-held dream for this couple, which they nurtured for years, the restaurant has been embellished with each passing year and now boasts a magnificent contemporary decor that is in total harmony with the warm rustic nature of its surroundings. The restaurant’s crowning glory is Riccardo Agostini’s technical, creative cuisine, which showcases the best seasonal, regional ingredients. This chef’s dishes are complex and elaborate in style yet never overly fussy. One of our favourite dishes was the spaghetto al verde with pink Adriatic prawns and pecorino cheese – this green-coloured Latini pasta with cavolo nero and chicory is served with delicious whole prawns with intense maritime flavours and just the right amount of pecorino to balance the bitter chicory with the sweet prawns. The interesting “Collina” tasting menu includes ingredients and traditions from the valley that extends from the source of the Marecchia river across the hills to the sea.
