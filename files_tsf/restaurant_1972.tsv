La Meridiana	via Rosmini 11	Domodossola	28845	Italy	€€	Seafood,ClassicCuisine	In business for over 50 years, this long-established, centrally located restaurant has changed its look over the years and is now a modern bistro with an attractive outdoor summer space overlooking the magical town centre. Here, the owner-chef serves fish prepared in two different ways, either in typical Italian tradition or in a style inspired by his native Spain – his paella is definitely worth sampling! The front of house is overseen by the owner’s friendly wife, who is also at hand to help with your wine choices.	Air conditioning	Mastercard, Visa	+39 0324 240858
