Da Bob Cook Fish	largo Parsano vecchio 16	Sorrento	80067	Italy	€€	Seafood	Working in partnership with the nearby fishmongers which supplies it with fresh fish and seafood, this restaurant occupies a building once used for storing oranges that dates back 400 years. Although there is a menu, given the restaurant’s close relationship with the fishmongers we recommend asking the serving staff about the catch of the day and taking a look in the glass cabinet where the fish are displayed. Dishes are classic and traditional, allowing the full flavour of the fresh fish to shine through.	Air conditioning, Terrace	Amex, Dinersclub, Mastercard, Visa	+39 081 1778 3873
