Maxi	via Luigi Serio 8	SS 145 Sorrentina km 14,500	Vico Equense	80069	€€€€	Creative	From the entrance to the Capo la Gala hotel, you head down to the seafront to this restaurant, where a long terrace overlooks the rocks – if you’re looking for a romantic place to eat, this is one of the best options on this coastline (there’s also an indoor dining room for inclement weather). The cuisine is equal to the setting, thanks to the chef from Ischia who skilfully creates imaginative dishes using ingredients from Campania.
