Dallo Zio	via Santa Chiara 16	Rimini	47921	Italy	€€	Seafood,ClassicCuisine	A beautifully kept restaurant just a stone’s throw from the Arch of Augustus. Warm and welcoming, the restaurant’s vintage style echoes the 19C origins of the building as well as the 1970s, the decade when it first opened. Divided into two floors with small tables set close together, the menu features meat dishes and, more especially, “fresh fish from Rimini’s fishing boats” prepared in delicious, classic recipes that often have their roots in local traditions.
