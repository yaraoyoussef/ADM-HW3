Il Giardino "Da Felicin"	via Vallada 18	Monforte d'Alba	12065	Italy	€€€	Piedmontese,ClassicCuisine	A bastion of classic Piedmontese cuisine, this restaurant housed in a beautiful period palazzo boasts a panoramic terrace and a romantic garden for alfresco dining. The dining rooms echo the palazzo’s sumptuous and traditional feel, as does the timeless, regional cuisine which is carefully prepared and full of delicious flavours. The building is also home to an “albergo diffuso” hotel, with some guestrooms in the building itself and others dotted around the village, including in Palazzo Boeri which also has a small spa (reservation required). The owners are happy to share their knowledge of the Langhe, either on their own guided tours or visits led by another local expert.
