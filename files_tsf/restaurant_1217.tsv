Muraglia - Conchiglia d'Oro	via Aurelia 133	Varigotti	17024	Italy	€€€	Seafood,ClassicCuisine	Here, choose between the simply furnished, bright dining room with a proudly vintage feel that dates back to its opening in the 1970s and a tiny yet attractive terrace with sea views (there are just a few tables, so it’s best to book in advance). Fish has always been – and still is – the house speciality, with fresh, top-quality dishes simply prepared according to classic methods such as the barbecue grill visible in the dining room. The fish is so fresh that the handwritten menu changes daily.	Terrace	Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 019 698015
