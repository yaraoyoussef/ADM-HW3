L'Erba del Re	via Castelmaraldo 45	Modena	41121	Italy	€€€	Creative	Situated in a period palazzo near one of Modena’s oldest churches (the façade of Santa Maria della Pomposa dates from the medieval period and the church was rebuilt in 1717), this bright, modern and minimalist restaurant has just a few tables set some distance apart and is adorned with contemporary paintings on its walls. Talented chef Luca Marchini focuses mainly on creative cuisine, although fans of more traditional fare will also find a few Emilian specialities on the menu. The excellent sommelier is also able to recommend interesting and rare wines from small-scale wineries, including from outside Italy and often by the glass.
