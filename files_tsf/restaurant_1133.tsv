Mec Restaurant	via Vittorio Emanuele 452	Palermo	90134	Italy	€€€	Sicilian,Contemporary	Occupying a 16C palazzo practically opposite the splendid cathedral in the heart of monumental Palermo, this unusual restaurant is accessed via a number of steps and shares space with an exhibition dedicated to Steve Jobs. Here, three elegant dining rooms with frescoed ceilings are surrounded by memorabilia and photographs that recall the professional career of this computer genius. In this setting, chef Carmelo Trentacosti focuses on Sicilian recipes and ingredients that he reinterprets with a personal twist, such as the famous caponata which is transformed into a creamy sauce (in the shape of the Apple logo) and seasoned with grated Modica chocolate which can be enjoyed with sourdough bread. An excellent cheese trolley (available before the dessert course) and attentive service complete the picture. At the end of your meal, ask to be shown the view of the piazza from the balcony – the perfect way to end a very special evening.
