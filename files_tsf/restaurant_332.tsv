Glam Enrico Bartolini	calle Tron	sestiere Santa Croce 1961	Venice	30135	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	The discreet, partially hidden entrance to Palazzo Venart opens into what is a rarity in Venice – a small but charming garden with beautiful furniture in what is a genuine orangery. A second garden overlooks the Grand Canal and offers tables where, in summer, guests can enjoy a coffee or liqueur after their meal. Nestled between these two gardens, a magnificent hotel is home to the restaurant itself, where Michelin-starred chef Enrico Bartolini and the highly talented resident chef Donato Ascani offer guests a fine-dining experience. There are two tasting menus: “Arte, orti e laguna” which features dishes that pay tribute to Venice and its culinary traditions, and “I Classici del Glam”, showcasing iconic dishes from the chef’s long career. Every course is prepared with the chef’s natural instinct for care and passion and is full of intense and harmonious flavours. The option of arriving here by boat makes this restaurant even more exclusive.
