Cielo	via Scipione Petrarolo 7	Ostuni	72017	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine,Contemporary	Cielo is the gourmet restaurant at the splendid and aptly named La Sommità hotel, which is housed in a typical old mansion right at the top of this whitewashed town with its limestone steps. The restaurant offers the perfect setting for a romantic summer dinner, either among the citrus trees in the small inner courtyard or in the dining room crowned with a vaulted ceiling. Boasting a highly respectable CV, the chef from Martina Franca serves modern reinterpretations of Puglian cuisine, while the delightful terrace is perfect for an aperitif at sunset. A simpler menu is available at lunchtime.	Air conditioning, Restaurant offering vegetarian menus, Terrace	Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 0831 305925
