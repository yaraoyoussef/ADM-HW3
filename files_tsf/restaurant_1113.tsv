Grual	via Alpe di Grual 16	Pinzolo	38086	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary,ItalianContemporary	Housed within the Lefay Resort & Spa Dolomiti, an elegant hotel that dominates Pinzolo and is one of the best hotels in the Trentino region, this gourmet restaurant takes its name from the mountain behind the hotel (the Grual). Here, in the evening, chef Matteo Maezza serves his own reinterpretations of typical mountain cuisine inspired by the three different altitudes from which he sources his ingredients. For example, the bottom of the valley (“fondovalle”) is the inspiration for his marinated whitefish from Lake Garda, served with different types of turnip and Mugo pine milk; the Alpine pasture region (“alpeggio”) has inspired the delicious rib of beef with mustard and carrots; while the high mountain area (“alta montagna”) is behind the elaborate saddle of venison with cardoon gratin with a beef marrow and creamed rye crust. There’s also an impressive wine list featuring an impressive selection of champagnes.
