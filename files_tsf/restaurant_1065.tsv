Borgo San Jacopo	borgo San Jacopo 62 r	Florence	50125	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine,ClassicCuisine	Housed within the Hotel Lungarno, one of the most charming hotels in the city, this restaurant boasts the same elegant and exclusive style as the hotel. Chef Claudio Mengoni is at the helm here, having gained experience working in various Michelin-starred restaurants before returning home to Florence about three years ago. Here, he transforms carefully chosen Italian ingredients into refined fish, meat and vegetable dishes which respect the seasons and are beautifully presented. Sommelier Salvatore Biscotti is responsible for the excellent wine selection, which includes around a thousand different labels featuring renowned estates and small producers alike. It’s well worth booking one of the few romantic tables overlooking the Arno.
