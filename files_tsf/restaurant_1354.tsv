Matteo Grandi in Basilica	piazza dei Signori 1	Vicenza	36100	Italy	€€€€	Farmtotable,Contemporary	Situated on the first floor of a beautiful building facing the Renaissance-style Basilica Palladiana, this restaurant run by Matteo Grandi and Elena Lanza boasts an elegant, contemporary-style dining room with windows offering views of the piazza. Chef Matteo now offers a new surprise menu, where guests simply decide on the number of courses they want (usually three, five or eight) and he does the rest, creating delicious cuisine prepared from the best ingredients available in the market that day – which means, of course, that the dishes can change daily. What remains unchanged, however, is his expertise and his intention to serve ingredients without adding unnecessary frills, just the occasional Asian twist thanks to his previous experience working in China. Elena continues to welcome guests and oversee the front of house, assisted by the sommelier and an impressive wine list. The bread here is also excellent.
