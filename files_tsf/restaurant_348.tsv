ES Cantina&Ristorante	contrada Reni	Manduria	74024	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine	Situated within the Gianfranco Fino wine estate, this tuff building houses a restaurant on its first floor with large picture windows that look out at the vineyards and a spacious terrace offering views of the surrounding countryside. Here, chef Simone Profeta from Naples serves modern meat and fish dishes, often cooked using wines from the estate, such as in the deliciously tender braised veal cheeks served with a full-bodied ES reduction. There’s also a vegetarian menu that features organic vegetables grown in the estate’s own kitchen garden. The wine list showcases the winery’s own labels of different vintages.
