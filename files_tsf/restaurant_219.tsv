Procaccini	Via Giulio Cesare Procaccini 33	Milan	20154	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine,Contemporary	Originally from Kosovo, talented chef Emin Haziri grew up in Italy and has plenty of professional culinary experience behind him. Here, he creates contemporary cuisine with a personal flavour, with raw seafood dishes such as oysters, caviar, Sicilian prawns and scampi available alongside his more imaginative options. In the elegant and stylish dining room with a harmonious colour scheme and fine furnishings, the open-view kitchen and marble chef’s table with velvet-covered stools really catch the eye. The restaurant also boasts a cocktail bar where guests can enjoy a drink and appetisers from the small tapas menu which is designed for sharing.
