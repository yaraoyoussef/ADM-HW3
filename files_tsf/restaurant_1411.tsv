Il Palagio	borgo Pinti 99	Florence	50121	Italy	€€€€	ItalianContemporary	Situated on the ground floor of the Palazzo della Gherardesca and surrounded by beautiful mature gardens, Il Palagio is a gourmet evening restaurant decorated in elegant, refined neo-Classic style. The cuisine focuses on Italian culinary traditions reinterpreted by chef Paolo Lavezzini, who describes himself as “Italian by heart and Brazilian by soul” (he spent many years working in Brazil). Although born in the region of Emilia, Lavezzini’s dishes fully respect Tuscan traditions embellished with the occasional Brazilian influence. Vegetarians are also catered for, with their own tasting menu.
