Carignano	via Carlo Alberto 35	Turin	10123	Italy	€€€€	Creative	Davide Scabin, one of Piedmont’s most famous chefs who was also awarded two Michelin starts at his Rivoli restaurant, continues to reinvent and apply himself with as much enthusiasm as ever. His backdrop is one of the most prestigious hotels in Turin – the historic Grand Hotel Sitea – where he serves a tasting menu that is both bold and innovative, surprising guests with the order of courses: you start with intense flavours and the dishes become lighter as the meal progresses. Scabin offers a superb gastronomic experience on one long tasting menu that includes traditional Piedmontese recipes and more creative dishes, as well as the occasional more exotic influence.
