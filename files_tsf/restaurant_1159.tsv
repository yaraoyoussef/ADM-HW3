Parma Rotta	strada Langhirano 158	Parma	43124	Italy	€€	Grills	Here, where the Parma river once broke its banks, you’ll find an attractive trattoria with pleasant dining rooms and excellent cuisine cooked over a wood and herb fire, one of the oldest culinary techniques in the world. The main courses feature meat only, with an extensive number of dishes on the menu. Among the home-made desserts, we recommend the fior di latte ice-cream, which is served with a choice of delicious sauces.
