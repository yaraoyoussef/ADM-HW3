Peter Brunel Ristorante Gourmet	via Linfano 47	Arco	38062	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine,ItalianContemporary	In this restaurant situated less than 1km from the shores of beautiful Lake Garda, chef Peter Brunel from Trentino not only creates contemporary cuisine but has also designed many of the decorative details in the dining room, demonstrating a truly artistic soul. The whole place is designed to provide an enjoyable gourmet experience, from the friendly welcome to the sofas and armchairs where guests can sit and enjoy an aperitif accompanied by some enticing appetisers. With the passing of time, Brunel has proven to be ever more skilful in showcasing the Trentino to Italy and the rest of the world, sometimes innikkei-style dishes, and sometimes in more Mediterranean fare with the occasional flight of fantasy inspired by the chef’s passion for Italian poet Gabriele D’Annunzio. Front of house, the equally brilliant Christian Rainer provides recommendations from the excellent wine list with an acclaimed professionalism that knows few equals.
