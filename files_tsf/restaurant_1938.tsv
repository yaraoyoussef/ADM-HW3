Locanda Don Serafino	via Avv. Ottaviano 13	Ragusa	97100	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Situated on the ring road which runs around Ibla, one of the most charming and picturesque historic districts in Sicily, this restaurant is as delightful as its surroundings. Despite being partly built into the rock, the dining room here is elegant rather than rustic and the service highly attentive, making this the perfect choice for a romantic, gourmet dinner. Vincenzo Candiano is an extraordinary chef who continues to experiment with new dishes, combining classic favourites with other more innovative recipes (still with a Sicilian influence) on his menu. There’s also a renowned wine list with some superb vertical tasting options, plus one guestroom on the premises and others within walking distance in the charming hotel of the same name.
