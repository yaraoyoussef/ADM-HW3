Castel fine dining	vicolo dei Castagni 18	Tirol	39019	Italy	€€€€	Creative,International	180° views of the Val Venosta provide the theatrical setting for chef Gerhard Wieser’s precise, technical cuisine at this restaurant, where the tasting menu changes with the seasons and focuses on the region, with the exception of a few ingredients such as the Sicilian scampi which offer an exquisite alternative to the meat dishes on offer here. Highlights include the local, organic suckling pig ravioli served with parmesan foam and three types of pepper (Szechuan, South Tyrolean and Indian) which add an original flavour to the dish. Talented sommelier Ivana is on hand to help with wine choices, paying careful attention to guests’ individual preferences, while praise is also due to Florian and his staff for their excellent service.
