Il Latini	via dei Palchetti 6 r	Florence	50123	Italy	€€	Tuscan,TraditionalCuisine	True to itself as always, Il Latini is a real Florentine institution, which continues to keep Tuscan traditions alive both in its small, rustic-style dining rooms and in its typical regional cuisine prepared with careful attention to detail and a respectful approach. Florentine steak takes pride of place on the menu, which also features the local hams that hang from the ceiling. Specialities include pappa al pomodoro, Florentine tripe and ribollita stew, as well as cantucci with vin santo, the typical finale to any Tuscan meal. Generations may pass but the appeal of this convivial and welcoming restaurant remains as strong as ever.	Air conditioning	Mastercard, Visa	+39 055 210916
