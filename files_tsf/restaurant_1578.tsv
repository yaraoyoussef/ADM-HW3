Il Poggio Rosso	località San Felice	Castelnuovo Berardenga	53019	Italy	€€€€	Creative	You cross a magical landscape of hills dotted with cypress and olive trees, woodland and vineyards to get to Borgo San Felice, the luxury hotel that is home to Poggio Rosso. Here, multi-Michelin-starred Enrico Bartolini has chosen his child prodigy Juan Quintero, originally from Colombia, as chef at the helm. Despite the chef’s origins, the cuisine is fundamentally creative and regionally influenced, with just a few South American touches here and there. Juan has fallen in love with Tuscany and he interprets the region’s cuisine with real elegance and contemporary flair. All of this in a luxurious yet unstuffy setting, with service which is impeccable and always accompanied by a smile.
