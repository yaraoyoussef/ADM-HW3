Casa Leali	via Valle 1	Puegnago sul Garda	25080	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary,ModernCuisine	Year after year, the young, enthusiastic Leali brothers demonstrate their ability to run a top-quality restaurant: their Casa, elegantly housed in a restored 15C farmhouse, has become a renowned name in the region. In the kitchen, Andrea is precise and attentive in his selection of seasonal produce, preferring to concentrate on just a few ingredients in each dish, which he transforms with technical expertise and imagination. One example is the oysters cooked over the barbecue grill, served with olive pesto and shallots – a truly interesting antipasto, in which the sinuous flavour of the oyster is retained while combining it with other more elegant and subtle bitter tastes. The bread is also delicious. Marco is at the helm front of house, where he also oversees the wine list, demonstrating a real love for champagne and other sparkling wines.
