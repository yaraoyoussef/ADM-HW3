Osteria Fernanda	via Crescenzo Del Monte 18/24	Rome	00153	Italy	€€€	Creative,Contemporary	In the district famous for its Porta Portese market, this restaurant run by two talented business partners is definitely worth a visit. Andrea oversees the minimalist-style dining room, while Luca demonstrates real passion in his creative cuisine made from locally sourced ingredients, as well as produce from further afield. Among the desserts, we highly recommended the Porter beer ice-cream with black garlic mousse, chocolate and tuber peelings.	Air conditioning	Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 06 589 4333
