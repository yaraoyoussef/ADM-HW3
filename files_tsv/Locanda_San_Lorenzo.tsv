Locanda San Lorenzo	via IV Novembre 79	Puos d'Alpago	32016	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,SeasonalCuisine	The Dal Farra family opened this inn way back in 1900, when the current owner-chef Renzo’s grandparents established a simple osteria-style restaurant to provide meals for workers at the nearby mill. In the 1950s, Renzo’s parents took over at the helm, with a Michelin star awarded to the restaurant in 1997. Passion and consistency are the characteristics that have drawn guests to this restaurant for over a century: the cuisine makes full use of regional ingredients in dishes that have occasionally been reinterpreted with a modern twist. Some guests may prefer the modern dining room, although regulars may well choose the more rustic-style room, where two of the tables are laid out right in front of the fireplace. There’s a good selection of wine, plus a few simple guestrooms on the upper floors.
