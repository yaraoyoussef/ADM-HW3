Trattoria al Cacciatore - La Subida	via Subida 52	Cormons	34071	Italy	€€€	RegionalCuisine,TraditionalCuisine	Situated amid beautiful rolling hills dotted with vineyards, this restaurant is perfect for anyone keen to sample authentic, traditional Friuli cuisine. One the most interesting restaurants in the region, the Trattoria al Cacciatore focuses on carefully chosen recipes and ingredients from this region, which has a rich and varied cuisine thanks to its location on the border with Slovenia and its historic links with Imperial Austria. The family owners will happily guide you through the options, which include wild herbs, frogs’ legs, mushrooms, radicchio, river fish, polenta and wild game, to name just a few of the delicacies on the menu. Among the main courses, the veal shank cooked in the bread oven, beautifully presented and carved in the dining room, deserves a special mention: for our inspectors, this dish is typical of the restaurant’s authentic, generous cuisine. As an alternative, Osteria della Subida serves traditional Friuli dishes and is open daily, including at lunchtime. The restaurant’s own wine and vinegar is available for purchase (also online).
