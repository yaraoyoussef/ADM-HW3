Incàlmo	viale Rimembranze 1	Este	35042	Italy	€€€	Contemporary	“Clean”, almost naive dishes full of clear and defined flavours take centre-stage at Incàlmo, where the cuisine is distinctly unfussy with no unnecessary frills. As a result, ingredients are clearly recognisable (as is the way they are prepared), allowing guests to focus on their contrasting textures and flavours. In the chef’s view, “if one element does stand out, it’s probably the bitter flavours that we enjoy playing with,” says the chef, “while at the same time balancing this with other elements. We also prioritise the use of vegetables.”	['Air conditioning', 'Car park', 'Terrace', 'Wheelchair access']	['Amex', 'Dinersclub', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0429 176 1472	https://www.incalmoristorante.com
