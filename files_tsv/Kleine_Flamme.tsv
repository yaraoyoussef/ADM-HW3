Kleine Flamme	via Cittanuova 31	Vipiteno	39049	Italy	€€€	Fusion,Creative	In his small open-view kitchen situated in the centre of this restaurant, chef Bacher Burkhard develops his vision of fusion cuisine with energy and precision, combining flavours from Italy and the Alto Adige with Asian spices and techniques to create delicious and imaginative dishes. His tuna tataki is superb, seasoned with salty lemon oil and accompanied by intriguing bitter herbs that (as Professor Montanari has noted in a recent book) are particularly popular with Italians. The chef’s wife Annelies works front of house, where she looks after guests in a friendly and professional manner.	['Terrace']	['Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0472 766065	https://kleineflamme.com/it/
