Gallo Nero	Via del Porrione 65/67	Sienna	53100	Italy	€€€	RegionalCuisine,Contemporary	Situated on the edge of the Leocorno contrada (district) just a stone’s throw from the Piazza del Campo, this restaurant with medieval origins has a recently renovated, designer-style dining room with a modern feel. Marco Langella from Campania is at the helm in the kitchen, where he reinterprets local culinary traditions in a modern style with a careful focus on flavour. He also offers a special tasting menu featuring meat and fish dishes. We particularly enjoyed the duck with orange, bitters and Taggiasche olives, and (perhaps even more!) the creamy, delicious dessert made with blue Erborinato cheese, dates and French toast. The beautiful wine cellar can also be visited by guests.	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	[]	+39 0577 284356	https://www.ristorantegallonero.it/
