Casa Vissani	vocabolo Cannitello	Baschi	05023	Italy	€€€€	Creative	After arriving at this restaurant and being greeted by the chef’s son Luca, you can spend time in the lakeside garden before heading into its elegant dining rooms. The first of these (known as the Welcome Rock) is where guests can enjoy an aperitif and place their orders, while the indoor dining room is the setting for elegant and impeccable service with open-view kitchens that are framed as if they were paintings. The tasting menus, which must be ordered in advance, are named after colours: Gold (Oro) is traditional in style; Red (Rosso) is dedicated to meat; Blue (Blu) to fresh- and saltwater fish; and Green (Verde) to vegetables. Lastly, BlackNerois a surprise menu chosen by the chef. Alongside its modern and original cuisine, the restaurant also offers traditional features such as bread and delicious breadsticks (a family recipe!). Luxury guestrooms are also available.
