La Braseria	via Risorgimento 15	Osio Sotto	24046	Italy	€€	MeatsandGrills,MediterraneanCuisine	This restaurant is a paradise for meat-eaters – its signature dishes are prime cuts of meat (mostly beef) from different breeds, which are displayed in the refrigerated cabinet at the entrance. There’s an extensive à la carte, with various appetiser options and a small choice of “primi”, but all the attention here is on the main course. The meat is either smoked and grilled over beech wood or roasted in the wood-fired oven – there’s something here for every taste! A cheese selection and delicious desserts complete the picture.
