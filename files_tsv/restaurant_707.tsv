Situated outside the village and surrounded by sweet chestnut trees and tufa rock, what was once an old trattoria now serves typical Piedmontese specialities, such as meat and borage ravioli with butter and crispy pancetta, as well as dishes from further afield. Charming outdoor area for summer dining, plus an early - 20C wine cellar which can be visited by guests.
