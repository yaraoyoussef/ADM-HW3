Linfa	piazza Sant'Agostino 19a	San Gimignano	53037	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Countrycooking	This restaurant is situated right in the historic centre of San Gimignano, yet slightly away from its main streets. Culture and a strong connection to the region are perfect companions to the fine flavours that chef Vincenzo Martella translates into delicious fish and meat dishes, often casually combining these different ingredients in the same dish. The beautiful presentation and attention to detail is echoed in the contemporary works of art that adorn the walls. Highly professional yet friendly service, with staff happy to offer recommendations, including assisting with your choice of wine.
