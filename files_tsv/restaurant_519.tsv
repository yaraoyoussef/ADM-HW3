Ansitz Romani	via Andreas Hofer 23	Termeno sulla Strada del Vino	39040	Italy	€€	RegionalCuisine,ModernCuisine	An attractive, well-kept restaurant in a historic building with a romantic, rural feel, especially in the beautiful garden. Although the menu is not that extensive, the chef is highly skilled, and it doesn’t feel as though anything is missing here. The dishes reflect the flavours of the region, making use of local ingredients such as venison and asparagus from Termeno accompanied by home-produced speck ham. The menu also features a couple of fish-based recipes and all dishes are modern and imaginative in style. Beautiful guestrooms are also available.
