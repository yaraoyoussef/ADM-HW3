Alpenroyal Gourmet	via Meisules 43	Selva di Val Gardena	39048	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	This is the gourmet restaurant at the hotel of the same name, one of the most luxurious in the Val Gardena. The elegant, contemporary dining room has an almost minimalist feel, with a softly lit ambience that would give the impression of a private home were it not for the huge garden (snow-covered in winter) visible through its windows. Although originally from Puglia, chef Mario Porcelli has been working in the Dolomites for many years and is equally at home with local dishes as he is with recipes from his native region. In both cases, his dishes are modern and beautifully presented in a manner that leaves nothing to chance.
