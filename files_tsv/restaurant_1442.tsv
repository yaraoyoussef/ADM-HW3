Calvi Ristorante	via Bari 134	Altamura	70022	Italy	€	Contemporary	This welcoming, contemporary-style restaurant with a large open-view kitchen serves two different types of cuisine – one regional and Mediterranean in style, the other more creative allowing the chef’s culinary skills to take centre stage. The black rice tacos with roasted eel, green beans, soya bean sprouts and spicy hummus mayo are truly delicious – definitely to be eaten with the hands!
