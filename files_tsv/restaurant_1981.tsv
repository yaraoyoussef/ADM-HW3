Visione Restaurant and Living	Strada Nicolini Basso 34	loc. Tre Stelle	Barbaresco	12050	€€€	Contemporary,Piedmontese	At this restaurant, new, young and enthusiastic managers work alongside a chef with Asian origins (who grew up in Italy) to offer a wide selection of dishes, many with an exotic flavour. Choose from an à la carte or two tasting menus, one of which has its roots in the regional traditions that are always held in high regard in Piedmont. Situated in the Casa Nicolini hotel in a quiet, panoramic location, the restaurant boasts fine views of the hills through its dining room windows and from its terrace, where a bar and bistro with a more concise and reasonably priced menu are set up in the summer months. The bistro also has its own small, dedicated dining room.	['Air conditioning', 'Car park']	['Amex', 'Maestrocard', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 328 134 0218	https://www.ristorantevisione.it
