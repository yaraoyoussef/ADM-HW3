Tana de 'l Ors	via Roma 28	Forno di Zoldo	32012	Italy	€€	ModernCuisine,Farmtotable	A favourite with food-lovers, this restaurant serves lighter meals at lunchtime which are nonetheless carefully and imaginatively prepared (don’t miss theorsoburger!). In the evening, the best daily ingredients are prepared with a lightly modern touch – meat is the undisputed start of the show, although a few fish dishes also feature. One-room and two-room apartments are also available.		Mastercard, Visa	+39 0437 794097
