Quadri	piazza San Marco 121 (primo piano)	Venice	30124	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine	Situated on the second floor of the historic café of the same name, this elegant restaurant,  with chef Sergio Preziosa at the helm of the kitchen, offers skilful reinterpretations of Venetian and Italian classics . With its ornate wallpaper, sumptuous chandeliers, view of St Mark’s Square and carefully restored 16C features, this is truly a restaurant for a special occasion. The opulence of the setting is deliberately lightened by the friendly service, which is occasionally playful and yet impeccable at all times.
