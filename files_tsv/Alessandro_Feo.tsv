Alessandro Feo	via Angelo Lista 24	Marina di Casal Velino	84040	Italy	€€	Campanian,Seafood	In a beautiful stone-vaulted building (an old 17C monastery) on the town’s seafront promenade, young owner-chef Alessandro Feo has made his mark in this region that perhaps has fewer gourmet restaurants than many places elsewhere. Here, he creates dishes that combine traditional influences and classic favourites from Campania with his own individual flair and creativity. His focus is on local, seasonal ingredients, including produce from his two kitchen gardens and fish sourced from local fishermen as well as from his own ventures out to sea.
