Borgo Sant'Anna	Località Sant'Anna 84	Monforte d'Alba	12065	Italy	€€€	Countrycooking,Creative	Pasquale Laera, originally from Puglia, has by now been working for years in Piedmont and has learned the rules and codes of the regional cuisine, broadening his horizons with suggestions–including tasting of game in season and on the menu–of colorful and generous dishes using ingredients targeting taste much more than appearance. Thorough searching, also outside his vegetable garden, for vegetables that, being from Puglia, he is able to fully enhance, as in the case of his autumn cartoccio: a mix of vegetable flavors to which Castelmagno cheese adds Piedmontese sapidity. The latest new thing is "Anima", a room designated for research into new ideas for the kitchen, but also exclusive hospitality with a table for 8 with a special menu.
