Pashà	via Morgantini 2	Conversano	70014	Italy	€€€€	Apulian,ModernCuisine	This restaurant is housed in one of the most important historic buildings in the town – the Seminario Vescovile (Bishop’s Seminary). The austere, majestic exterior contrasts with the contemporary elegance of the dining room, while the cuisine continues to focus on dishes firmly rooted in the region, albeit with the occasional modern twist. Chef Antonio Zaccardi is at the helm here, creating various tasting menus on which he demonstrates skills and techniques acquired over the years, focusing on just a few ingredients so that every dish explodes with intense and generous flavours. His wife Angelica Giannuzzi is equally as talented, creating pastries and desserts that are out of the ordinary and full of personality. Antonio Magistà oversees the front of house with skill and elegance, fully confident in the restaurant’s excellent wine list which is dominated by champagnes and wines from Puglia and Bordeaux.
