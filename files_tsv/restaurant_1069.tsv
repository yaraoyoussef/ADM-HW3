Vescovado	piazzale Rosselli	Noli	17026	Italy	€€€€	Ligurian,ModernCuisine	The Ricchebuono family has long been renowned for their excellent cuisine and warm welcome, and now that the couple’s two enthusiastic children have joined their parents at the restaurant, this is truer than ever. Father Giuseppe is the pivot here, a skilful and precise chef who creates elegant and minimalist cuisine from delicious local ingredients, such as fish from Noli which is listed on the menu in dialect (for example, “cicetta” is monkfish). His son and daughter work front of house alongside their mother, with Martina supervising the wine list (subdivided into three sections – Liguria; the rest of the world; wines available by the glass), while her brother Elia is responsible for the cheese trolley, which features exclusively regional cheeses. In season, dine on the splendid panoramic terrace overlooking the small bay in Noli. Guestrooms are also available in the 15C Palazzo Vescovile which is the setting for the restaurant.
