Podere 39	via Senese 39 r	Florence	50125	Italy	€	Tuscan,Countrycooking	Housing just a few tables (booking is recommended), this restaurant is attractively decorated with an original melting-pot of features which give it a rustic yet elegant feel despite its small size. Some of the ingredients come from the restaurant’s own farm (hence the name “podere”, the Italian for farm), with both meat and fish dishes featuring on the menu.
