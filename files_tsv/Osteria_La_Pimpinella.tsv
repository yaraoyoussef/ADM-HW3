Osteria La Pimpinella	Via San Rocco 70	Bra	12042	Italy	€€	Contemporary,RegionalCuisine	Situated in the historic centre but near a square with a car park, this modern inn serves Piedmontese cuisine which is contemporary in style yet still firmly anchored in local traditions. The generously portioned, well-presented dishes on the menu include vitello tonnato (excellent – we tried it!), tajarin pasta, Bra sausage and casseroles (the soft suckling pig cheek was delicious), all of which are as much a feast for the eyes as for the palate. The restaurant is run by an enthusiastic couple, aided by proficient and courteous staff with a feminine touch.
