Blum	via Nazionale 147	Taormina	98039	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine	Although there is an extensive à la carte at this restaurant, it is on the tasting menus that the chef showcases his creative cuisine to the full. His Suggestioni menu features dishes such as scampi carpaccio with green apple and caviar, while the vegetarian Naturalmente option includes a robustly structured black garlic and almond noodle dish full of decisive flavours, which is well worth trying. The romantic, modern platform where tables are set out is practically on the beach, which means that the restaurant is closed in bad weather.
