Enoteca Pinchiorri	via Ghibellina 87	Florence	50122	Italy	€€€€	ItalianContemporary	The cuisine at Pinchiorri is striking for its opulent and grandiose style which impresses without becoming overly fussy or excessive, so that the main focus in every dish is the flavour of its ingredients. The magnificent feast of courses resembles a firework display, with each course more impressive than the last in a growing crescendo of delights. It’s worth coming here simply to experience the service, an impeccable waltz directed by Alessandro Tomberli, one of the best maître-d’s in Italy. Annie Féolde, one of the restaurant’s icons, left the reins to the highly talented chef Riccardo Monco, who continues to nurture and satisfy the Italian appetite for fine cuisine. Credit must also go to Giorgio Pinchiorri, who has developed a wine list that is renowned across the globe.
