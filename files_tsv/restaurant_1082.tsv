Trattoria da Me	via San Felice 50/a	Bologna	40122	Italy	€€	Emilian,Contemporary	This lively and very busy trattoria run by the energetic Elisa owes its success to a winning combination of traditional dishes (the fresh hand-made pasta, also sold in the shop next door, is a particular highlight) and specialities reinterpreted with a touch of imagination by the female chef, such as the ossobuco cut lengthways. You may like to try both by choosing a typical Bolognese dish as a starter followed by one of the chef’s more original options for your main course.
