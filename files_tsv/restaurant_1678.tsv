Ladinia	strada Pedercorvara 10	Corvara in Badia	39033	Italy	€€€	RegionalCuisine,ItalianContemporary	Both the Berghotel Ladinia and its restaurant of the same name boast a warm, vintage Alpine-style ambience, with wood decor that tells the story of this business which opened as a simple inn back in 1930. Little has changed since then and guests return here time after time thanks to the warm welcome and attention to detail offered by the Costa family. The traditional cuisine has the occasional modern twist, while the few Ladin-style guestrooms are decorated with a profusion of wood.
