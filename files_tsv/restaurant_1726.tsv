Ristorante del Lago	via Acquapartita 147	Bagno di Romagna	47021	Italy	€€€	CuisinefromRomagna,ModernCuisine	Once off the main road, follow a series of twists and turns uphill to reach the village of Acquapartita, at an altitude of almost 800m, where you’ll find one of the best restaurants in the region. Here, the Bravaccini brothers are at the helm, with chef Simone creating dishes that are proudly focused on local ingredients such as mushrooms, trout and game. His signature dish of wild boar is delicious and full of flavour – the meat is sliced tartare-style so that it cooks quickly and is then served covered with soft mashed potatoes sprinkled with juniper. Front of house, his friendly and skilful brother Andrea oversees an encyclopaedic wine list – two volumes featuring almost 1 600 labels, with a focus on Italy and France (almost 40% of the wines are French). The choice of wines is as impressive as the quantity and the service. All in all, an excellent choice!
