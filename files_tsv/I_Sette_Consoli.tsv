I Sette Consoli	piazza Sant'Angelo 1/a	Orvieto	05018	Italy	€€	ModernCuisine,SeasonalCuisine	In this simple restaurant boasting an attractive outdoor summer garden and splendid views of the Duomo, chef Anna Rita focuses on carefully selected ingredients from the region and beyond. Highlights include soft egg, pan-fried courgettes and spring onions, and pecorino crumble, as well as soft veal rump, Jerusalem artichoke sauce and home-made pickled vegetables. The wine and spirits selection is particularly appealing – as an example, the Orvieto Classico Superiore Doc “Vendemmia Tardiva” is the perfect pairing for your dessert.
