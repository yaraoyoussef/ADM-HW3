Villa Salina	Via Santuario 25	Moretta	12033	Italy	€€	Piedmontese,SeasonalCuisine	Named after Edoardo Salina, the chef to the House of Savoy, this villa from the mid-1800s features several rooms embellished with frescoed ceilings. The bold owner-chef here has completely restored the building, bringing it back to life and using it as a backdrop for his evolving culinary skills which started out in the family pasticceria. Nowadays, this “multi-tasking” modern restaurant offers a regionally inspired à la carte alongside fish dishes and a business menu option at lunchtime, while in the evening the menu includes a selection of high-quality pizzas. In summer, the dining room opens out onto a beautiful veranda and guests can also wander through the well-kept garden, which is now owned by the local municipality.
