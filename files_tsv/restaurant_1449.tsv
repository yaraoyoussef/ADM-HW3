Il Ritrovo d'Abruzzo	Contrada Bosco 16	Civitella Casanova	65010	Italy	€€	Countrycooking,ModernCuisine	If you’re not already in the area, it takes time to get to this family-run restaurant situated amid the rolling hills of rural Abruzzo, but the journey through some of the most beautiful scenery in the region more than compensates for the effort. Two brothers are at the helm (one front of house, the other in the kitchen), serving traditional regional cuisine often prepared using home-grown vegetables and with the occasionally more creative dish featuring on the menu. A pleasant outdoor space for summer dining completes the picture.
