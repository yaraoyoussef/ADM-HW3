Contraste	via Giuseppe Meda 2	Milan	20136	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine,Innovative	When you make a reservation at this restaurant, you’re invited to choose between two tasting menus which are described in inspirational terms rather than in detail. The surprise continues at your table, which is laid out in a splendid dining room with historic features, and where the courses arrive unannounced in a long succession of dishes made from ingredients that often imitate other ingredients – the result is playful, surprising cuisine that is truly extraordinary. Chef Matias Perdomoalso revives the South American tradition of grilling which results in dishes full of flavour. The grand finale is a delicious rose cake, plus an impressive selection of digestifs to bring the spectacle to a conclusion.
