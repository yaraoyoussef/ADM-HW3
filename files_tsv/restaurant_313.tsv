L'Antico Giardino	via Martelli 28	Ravalle	44123	Italy	€€	ModernCuisine	Choose from an interesting, traditional à la carte and two tasting menus (one autumn-based, the other traditional, both excellent value for money) at this comfortable restaurant, where guests are welcomed by the friendly owner who is on hand to offer wine pairing recommendations. The menu features meat tartares and flans, agnolotti and ravioli pasta, and superbly cooked, top-quality cuts of meat, with truffles often making an appearance in season. We visited in autumn and particularly enjoyed the pumpkin cappellaccio with butter, sage and almonds – a dish that stood out for its delicious, creamy flavours.
