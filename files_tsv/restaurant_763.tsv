Ristorante 1500	via Pavicolo 43	funivia per raggiungere il ristorante in via Villa 3	San Vigilio	39011	€€€	ModernCuisine,Contemporary	If you’re not a guest at the Vigilius Mountain Resort hotel where this restaurant is situated, leave your car in Lana and take the short cable-car ride to Monte San Vigilio where you’ll find the hotel at an altitude of 1 500m (remember to check the time of the last cable-car back down the mountain!). Decorated with a profusion of wood, the dining room has the same modern feel as the creative mountain cuisine prepared by the new chef who started here in 2023.
