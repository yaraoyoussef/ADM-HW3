L'Acciuga	viale Francesco Baracca 74	Ravenna	48121	Italy	€€	Seafood	Anchovies, king prawns, cuttlefish and freshly caught fish are just some of the options available in this restaurant specialising in fish and seafood, where guests will be delighted by the fresh flavours of the ingredients. The small wine list, which also includes a few non-Italian labels, offers good value for money. The maritime-style decor evokes the interior of an old ship, while the warm welcome is typical of the region. All in all, an excellent choice!
