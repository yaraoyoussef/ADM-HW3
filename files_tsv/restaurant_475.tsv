Tivoli	località Lacedel 34	Cortina d'Ampezzo	32043	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine,Italian	This restaurant occupies an attractive Alpine house outside the town centre on the road to the Falzarego pass and at the foot of the Tofane mountains. Here, the chef shows himself to be completely at ease with both traditional cuisine and more creative fare. Using top-quality ingredients from this mountainous region, as well as fresh fish sourced daily from the markets at Venice and Chioggia, owner Graziano Prest creates delicious dishes full of generous flavours. Wine is another of his passions, hence the top-quality labels, historic vintages and renowned French bottles that can be found in the wine cellar here. The panoramic terrace boasts picture-postcard views of Cortina, as does the dining room – but only if you request one of the two tables by the window when you book!
