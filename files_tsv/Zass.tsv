Zass	via Laurito 2	Positano	84017	Italy	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine,Contemporary	The legendary San Pietro is one of the jewels of the Amalfi Coast as well as one of the most famous hotels in the world. Zass, its Michelin-starred restaurant, is extremely popular with visitors (booking in advance is highly recommended) thanks to skilful Belgian chef Alois Vanlangenaeker, who has now been here for over 20 years. His cuisine showcases all the colours and flavours of the Mediterranean with harmony and elegance, focusing mainly on the traditions of Campania, especially in appetisers such as the small bites of lightly baked Pizza Margherita and in creative dishes elsewhere on the menu. Many of his ingredients are sourced from the hotel’s kitchen garden, which he uses to create dishes based on meat and, especially, fish, including his signature John Dory (flavoured with lemon and accompanied by mashed potatoes with bufala yoghurt, seasonal vegetables and his famous Champagne and truffle sauce), and other fish such as mullet, sea bass, scampi and squid. Excellent service, a pianist providing background music, and an idyllic terrace boasting stunning views all play their part in making this a truly memorable dining experience.
