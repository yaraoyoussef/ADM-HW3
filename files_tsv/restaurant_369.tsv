Dolomieu	via Castelletto Inferiore 10	Madonna di Campiglio	38086	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary	Dolomieu is an intimate Stube-style restaurant furnished in oak which features just six tables, so booking well in advance is recommended. This is the most traditional part of the DV Chalet hotel, which otherwise boasts a modern and trendy Alpine-style decor. The tasting menu focuses on ingredients from the surrounding valleys, while the à la carte features interesting and tempting dishes such as ravioli with goat’s curd, raw Sicilian prawns and black truffle finished with a delicate chicken broth. Different wines are offered by the glass, all chosen by a maître-sommelier who is equally fond of wines from outside Italy.
