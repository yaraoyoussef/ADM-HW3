Orma Roma	via Boncompagni 31	Rome	00187	Italy	€€€€	ItalianContemporary,Colombian	An oak door with three steps leads into the dining room which extends towards the kitchen in this restaurant designed by a renowned Milanese studio, whose predilection for wood is typified by the beautiful oval-shaped dining tables. Famous chef Roy Caceres (originally from Colombia but now decidedly Roman) is at the helm here, serving a successful combination of ingredients from Lazio and his native country with occasional influences from elsewhere in Italy. The menu features dishes such as Abruzzo mutton with ‘nduja sausage served with Castelfranco radicchio. The chef is happy to introduce himself and share his ideas with guests, adding to the sense of welcome and conviviality here. The wine cellar is as well thought out as the dining room, offering the perfect venue for a quick aperitif, while in summer the outdoor terrace comes into its own for cocktails and bistro dining.
