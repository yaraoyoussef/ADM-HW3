Gambero Rosso	via Montezemolo 65	Marina di Gioiosa Ionica	89046	Italy	€€€	Seafood	Gambero Rosso was founded in the 1970s, when Anna Maria and Giuseppe Sculli decided to pay tribute to the sea that they had previously left as emigrants. Since then, the restaurant has become a focus for the whole family. As a result, a new chapter is now being written with the arrival of a new generation: Riccardo at the helm in the kitchen and Francesco front of house. They source their fish from small-scale fishermen all along the Ionian coast, as far as Reggio Calabria, focusing not only on the quality of the fish but also on the way that it is caught. The raw fish options are renowned here, as are the first and second courses which combine fish and seafood with vegetables. From September 2024, the restaurant will also have a few charming guestrooms available.
