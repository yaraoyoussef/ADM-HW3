Trattoria Porteri	via Trento 52/d	Brescia	25128	Italy	€€	Lombardian,RegionalCuisine	This long-established family restaurant dates back 150 years, while the old town of Borgo Trento in which it is situated, although now surrounded by the modern city, has a much older history. Having run the delicatessen for many years (some of its products are used in the restaurant), the Porteri family has also been in charge of the trattoria here for decades. Renowned for its traditional Brescia cuisine, the restaurant serves specialities such as polenta, cheeses and meat dishes. Inspired by local recipes, the cuisine is made from top-quality ingredients sourced from small-scale producers from the region.
