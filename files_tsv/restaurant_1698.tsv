Piano35	corso Inghilterra 3	Turin	10138	Italy	€€€€	ItalianContemporary,Piedmontese	On the ground level of what has become one of the icons of the Turin cityscape–the Intesa San Paolo skyscraper designed by Renzo Piano–there is the entrance to the restaurant. Here the lift will take you, at high speed, up to a height of 150 meters. A visit to the panoramic terrace is a must before sitting in the dining room surrounded by the conservatory, the gastronomic choice envisages tasting paths dedicated to the city and other more creative ones; this is for the evening and gourmet version, while at lunchtime the offering is simpler.
