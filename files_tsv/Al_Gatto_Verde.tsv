Al Gatto Verde	Stradello Bonaghino 56	Modena	41126	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary,Emilian	Al Gatto Verde is situated within the walls of the Casa Maria Luigia, the welcoming country house run by Massimo Bottura and his wife Laura Gilmore which is popular with a cosmopolitan clientele. Here, the focus is on wood-fired cuisine – several dishes on the menu are finished over the fire, including tortellini au gratin with 36-month aged Parmesan and Montreal lamb, the latter a recipe from the chef’s native Canada which has been reinterpreted, flavoured with spices, cooked on a spit and served with pear purée. Both the dining room and the verdant outdoor space have a welcoming feel, while the service is friendly and attentive.
