Signum	via Scalo	Malfa	98050	Italy	€€€€	Sicilian,Contemporary	Situated in the Aeolian Islands, this charming inn is home to young chef Martina Caruso who, having practically grown up here, has returned home to take up the reins at Signum after formative experiences elsewhere. Today, this young chef leads a team of nine in the kitchen, while her brother manages the charming hotel built to resemble a typical Aeolian hamlet. Martina knows exactly how to bring out the best of the vibrant ingredients sourced from the region, her own kitchen garden and the nearby sea – she allows the power of these ingredients to shine forth yet manages to make light and playful use of their intense flavours, showcasing their qualities instead of trying to hide them. Luca and cousin Raffaele enhance this gourmet experience with excellent wines (some home-produced), also available by the glass, and superb cocktails.
