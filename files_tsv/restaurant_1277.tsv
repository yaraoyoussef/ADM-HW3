Santamonica	lungomare Lombardo 27	Genoa	16145	Italy	€€€	Seafood,ModernCuisine	Head down to the beach along a narrow street parallel to Corso Italia in the Albaro district of the city to reach this restaurant, where the views from both the dining room and summer terrace embrace the sea to the full. And it is, of course, from the latter that most of its ingredients are sourced (it’s not a coincidence that half a page on the menu is dedicated to raw fish dishes), with Santamonica’s chefs creating modern dishes with a strong emphasis on beautiful presentation. As an example, the traditional, fresh and crispy marinated anchovies are plated with geometric precision and attractively embellished with pine nuts and confit cherry tomatoes.
