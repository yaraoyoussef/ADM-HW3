Borgo Spoltino	strada Selva Alta	Mosciano Sant'Angelo	64023	Italy	€	CuisinefromAbruzzo,TraditionalCuisine	Borgo Spoltino occupies a 19C farmhouse amid hills and olive groves with views of the sea and mountains as a backdrop. This is the perfect setting in which to enjoy typical Abruzzi cuisine (most of the vegetables come from the restaurant’s own kitchen garden). These include traditional specialities such as sweet pizza (alternating layers of sponge cake soaked in Kermes liqueur, pudding and custard – a bit like a trifle – with a thick cream and slivers of almond, either on top or in the middle). The wine list features a good selection of regional wines, alongside labels from further afield.
