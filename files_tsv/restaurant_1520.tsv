Fradis Minoris	Laguna di Nora	Pula	9050	Italy	€€€€	Sardinian,ModernCuisine	Originally from Sardinia, chef Francesco Stara has returned home to his native island where he focuses on completely “circular” cuisine in this restaurant situated in a protected marine area. The fish is either local or from the Nora lagoon, which also provides the chef with a selection of wild herbs, while the vegetables are sourced from small-scale producers in nearby Campidano. On its two tasting menus (one fish and seafood, the other vegetarian), this excellent restaurant focuses on the best possible seasonal ingredients, as well as protecting the environment and showcasing the island’s traditions in its new, contemporary-style cuisine. Friendly, attentive service and a wine list featuring several regional labels complete the picture.
