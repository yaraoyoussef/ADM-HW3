Le Case della Saracca	via Cavour 5	Monforte d'Alba	12065	Italy	€€	Piedmontese,Italian	Situated in the delightful Saracca district (Monforte’s old historic centre), this restaurant occupies an old, restored house with a glass and steel decor that provides a harmonious contrast with the building’s original features. Tables are arranged on different levels connected by a series of vertiginous staircases. Quiet and intimate, the restaurant serves a dual purpose: there’s a wine bar for aperitifs, while the dining room provides the backdrop for dishes from the region and further afield. Superb wine list with various labels available by the glass, plus guestrooms that offer the chance to spend the night in this unique setting.
