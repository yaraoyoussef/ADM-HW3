La Conchiglia	Lungomare 33	Arma di Taggia	18011	Italy	€€€	ClassicCuisine	This small restaurant with a vaulted ceiling provides the setting for dishes that have by now become classics thanks to their focus on top-quality ingredients. The cuisine is light and simple rather than bold and elaborate, with a focus on bringing out the full flavour of the fish (a few meat dishes are also available). If you’re keen to learn more about Ligurian gastronomic specialities, take time between courses to chat with the friendly owner, who has an impressive knowledge of the region.
