Le Petit Bellevue	rue Grand Paradis 22	Cogne	11012	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary,CuisinefromtheAostaValley	Situated in one of the region’s most famous and romantic hotels, this small gem of a restaurant offers just a few seats at period-style tables in a small dining room, in addition to two tables with scenic views of the valley and Gran Paradiso. Here, the Tuscan chef focuses on specialities from the Aosta Valley, including popular dishes such as Lillaz char with roe and a butter sauce, and “zuppa del bosco” (stewed seasonal mushrooms served with Aosta blue cheese and a pinch of fresh marjoram), followed by an extraordinary cheese trolley that focuses on regional specialities. Last but not least, talented sommelier Rino Billia (a previous winner of the “passion for wine” award) demonstrates skilful understanding of guests’ requirements as he chooses the most suitable wine for them out of the more than 1 600 labels on the wine list.
