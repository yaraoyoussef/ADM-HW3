Campo Cedro	via Pian d'Ovile 54	Sienna	53100	Italy	€€	ItalianContemporary,MediterraneanCuisine	Situated just a stone’s throw from the centre yet away from the tourist crowds, this restaurant is well worth the effort needed to find it! Here, Japanese chef Sugihara, who has more than 20 years’ experience working in Italy, creates modern and skilfully prepared Italian meat and fish dishes which are fresh and elaborate. You’ll nearly always find seafood risotto on the menu, which is made with fish, mussels and finely chopped shrimps all cooked together with rice and then sprinkled with crumbled seaweed and dotted with tomato paste. Excellent value for money!	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	['Amex', 'Dinersclub', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0577 236027	http://www.campocedro.com
