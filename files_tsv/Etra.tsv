Etra	piazza De Ferrari 4	Genoa	16121	Italy	€€€	Creative,ItalianContemporary	Etra is an anagram of the Italian word “arte” – an apt name for this restaurant, which is housed in Palazzo Doria De Fornari on the beautiful and famous Piazza Ferrari. This palazzo is one of Genova’s magnificent “Rolli” palazzi (noble palaces once used to house famous visitors to the city). Despite the setting, the dining room is modern in style and adorned with elegant works of contemporary art. Here, chef Davide Cannavino consolidates his reputation with a concise menu of creative dishes: around a dozen meat and fish options inspired by the beauty that surrounds him and showcased on two tasting menus from which individual dishes can be chosen à la carte style.
