L'Arcade	lungomare Gramsci snc	Porto San Giorgio	63822	Italy	€€€	Contemporary,Seafood	This restaurant wholeheartedly embraces the sea, whether via its views visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows in the dining room, or through its cuisine with its focus on fish and seafood. Dishes are served on a tasting menu (from which single dishes can also be chosen à la carte), with a meat menu also available if booked ahead of time. Chef Sergeev Nikita, who arrived in Italy as a child, creates technically skilful, creative cuisine which is both surprising and entertaining.
