Il Frantoio	via del Castello 40	Colle di Val d'Elsa	53034	Italy	€€	ItalianContemporary,ModernCuisine	The 19C millstone, press and cisterns can still be seen in the dining room at this restaurant, bearing witness to its past as an olive oil mill. Situated in spectacular Colle di Val d’Elsa, Il Frantoio boasts old stone and brick walls and vaulted ceilings, as well as tables set out in the piazza for summer dining. Although the setting suggests simple and rustic cuisine, the chef surprises guests with top-quality dishes which are technical and often highly creative, such as liver with sour cherries and pistachios, and smoked spaghetti with an anchovy sauce, capers and black garlic cream.
