Overseen by chef Emanuele Scarello, the resident chef here is the young and talented Lorenzo Lai who serves two tasting menus: “LagunAmare” features top-quality fish while the “Giardino delle Rose” is a vegetarian menu based on vegetables grown in the restaurant’s own garden. Both menus showcase the rich selection of produce available in the lagoon and the biodiversity of the island itself. On summer evenings, an aperitif on the charming outdoor terrace is highly recommended.
