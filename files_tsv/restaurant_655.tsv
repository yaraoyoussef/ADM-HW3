Lo Scalco Grasso	via Trieste 55	Mantua	46100	Italy	€€	Mantuan,ModernCuisine	A small, intimate restaurant with a welcoming ambience and simple yet lively feel, where the owner-chef at the helm in the kitchen also makes an appearance front of house. Mantuan traditions are evident in the generous portion sizes as well as in dishes such as the legendary pumpkin tortelli (served with butter or a tomato and sausage sauce), while other options are more creative in style – the Emilian lamb tartare delicately flavoured with its own cooking juices, and served with sautéed chard, savoury sbrisolona cake and black truffles from the lower Mantova region in season is particularly delicious.
