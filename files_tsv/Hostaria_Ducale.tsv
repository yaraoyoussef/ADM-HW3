Hostaria Ducale	Salita di San Matteo 29 r	Genoa	16123	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,Creative	Situated just behind the beautiful Piazza De Ferrari, this restaurant with a quiet ambience and elegant decor provides the backdrop for young chef Daniele Rebosio’s superb, ever-evolving cuisine, which is modern, creative and imaginative and yet inspired by regional traditions. Equally at ease with meat and fish, Rebosio occasionally combines the two in one dish, as evidenced by his veal tongue served with langoustine (carpaccio marinated in passion fruit and salted biscuit stuffed with tartare) or with ravioli with rabbit and mussels dedicated to Fabrizio De André’s song Crêuza de mä .
