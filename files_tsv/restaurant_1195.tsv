Osteria Il Cappello	piazzetta Bruno Lunelli 5	Trento	38122	Italy	€€	ClassicCuisine,Italian	The outdoor terrace at this restaurant overlooks a pleasant pedestrian piazza in the historic centre, while the welcoming dining rooms are decorated in a style typical of the Trentino. The cuisine – reliable, seasonal and full of flavour – is traditionally Italian, yet with a contemporary touch. The menu also features a few regional options as well as the occasional fish dish. The quail stuffed with acacia honey, pumpkin purée and stewed radicchio is superb.
