La Torre	strada Spicciano 7	Tavarnelle Val di Pesa	50028	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Il Castello del Nero, the spectacular 12C residence that is home to this restaurant, stands in a magical location that includes many of the attractions that make Tuscany such a special place to visit – a breathtaking view from its summer terrace, an elegant dining room full of history, and top-quality ingredients such as extra-virgin olive oil and wine (the attractive wine cellar boasts a generous selection of the latter). However, the main attraction here is the excellent cuisine made by friendly chef Di Pirro, which is technical, creative and at the same time full of flavour, and always beautifully presented as befits the charming setting. The property is home to a kitchen garden (cultivated organically although as yet not certified organic) which boasts up to 10 varieties of tomato alongside a number of fruit trees. The restaurant offers three menus: the “Evoluzione Vegetali” vegetarian option; “La Terra”, in which meat dishes take pride of place; and “Il Mare”, featuring fish and seafood specialities. Last but not least, the dessert menu is striking for its extraordinarily imaginative sweets, as well as delicacies such as mini cakes, chocolates and macaroons served with your coffee.
