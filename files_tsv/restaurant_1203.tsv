Duomo	via Cap. Bocchieri 31	Ragusa	97100	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary,Creative	Chef Ciccio Sultano provides an intimate portrait of Sicily at this restaurant situated just a stone’s throw from the Duomo di San Giorgio in the heart of Ibla, one of the most charming historic centres in Sicily. Drawing on his deep knowledge of the region, he creates some of the island’s most spectacular cuisine, which is served in comfortable, intimate dining rooms. There are two tasting menus, from which dishes can also be chosen à la carte. We highly recommend the pasta with sea urchin, chard and hazelnuts.
