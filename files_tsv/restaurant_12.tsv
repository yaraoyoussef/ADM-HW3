La Trattoria Enrico Bartolini	Località Badiola	Castiglione della Pescaia	58043	Italy	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine,Grills	After a majestic picture-postcard approach via a long avenue lined with cypress trees and maritime pines, passing vineyards and Maremma cattle along the way, you finally arrive at this restaurant which serves trattoria-style cuisine full of intense, familiar and reassuring flavours. The decor here is elegant with the occasional rustic touch, while the service is of the highest level yet pleasantly friendly and informal. Welcome to Bartolini’s Maremma restaurant! Here, resident chef Bruno De Moura Cossio offers a choice of dishes with one common denominator, namely charcoal grilling. All the dishes served here have been grilled in some way, so that they have a distinctive barbecued flavour. However, although the chef’s Brazilian origins are obvious in many different ways, the ingredients are resolutely local, some even from the restaurant’s own farm. The friendly service makes guests feel completely at home, while the excellent wine selection is an added attraction – those produced on the estate itself are highly recommended.
