Adelaide	via dell'Arancio 69	Rome	186	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary	Although it’s not obvious from the exterior, once you’ve crossed the threshold of the Vilòn hotel you step into a succession of highly decorated rooms that are full of charm. The cuisine is of the highest quality, showcasing dishes from chef Gabriele Muro’s native Campania alongside the famous pasta specialities of his adopted city (amatriciana, carbonara, cacio e pepe etc), and finishing with the superb “l’oro di Procida” dessert.
