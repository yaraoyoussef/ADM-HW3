Locanda Altobelli	via Santissima Annunziata 121	Terracina	4019	Italy	€€	TraditionalCuisine	A pleasant little restaurant that differs from the many fish options in town with its traditional regional meat-based cuisine. There’s a real alchemy here between the young owner who is passionate about wine and the talented chef who boasts an impressive CV. Carefully chosen ingredients sourced directly from small local producers are the basis for its exciting, delicious dishes, while the wine list features some interesting organic wines. Small outdoor space for alfresco dining.	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	['Amex', 'Maestrocard', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 346 825 6622	nan
