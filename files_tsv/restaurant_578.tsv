Schöneck	via Schloss Schöneck 11	Molini	39030	Italy	€€€	RegionalCuisine,ClassicCuisine	With over 30 years’ experience behind them, the Baumgartner brothers’ restaurant is an excellent choice for classic specialities from the Alto Adige, offering a menu that focuses on regional dishes yet also includes a few fish-based options. The most important feature here is that all specialities are made from top-quality ingredients (often locally sourced), prepared by chef Karl with an expertise that ignores modern trends and passing fashions. Meals are served in rooms that are elegantly decorated with local wood, including a beautiful lounge space with a piano in front of the bar, Stube-style dining rooms and a veranda, while in summer the cool, shady terrace is particularly appealing. Last but not least, the excellent wine list is as impressive as the cuisine.
