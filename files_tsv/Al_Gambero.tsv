Al Gambero	via Roma 11	Calvisano	25012	Italy	€€€	Lombardian,ClassicCuisine	Antonio and Mariapaola, the current generation at the helm of this restaurant (ably assisted by the next generation), have had huge success here, having achieved and maintained a Michelin star for decades. The couple have embraced a culinary approach that focuses on traditional recipes, bringing them back to life and adding the chef’s own original twist. His dishes demonstrate a personal and delicate touch in the preparation of carefully selected ingredients, such as wild game and fish-based recipes, all of which require great skill on the part of the chef. The end result is delicious – reading the menu you’ll want to try almost everything! Both the service and the table settings are classic in style, as is the excellent, fairly priced wine list.
