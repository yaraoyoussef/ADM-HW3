Il Convivio Troiani	vicolo dei Soldati 31	Rome	00186	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary	A long-established restaurant that was opened in the early 1990s by three brothers from the Marche: Angelo in the kitchen, and Giuseppe and Massimo front of house. Since then, this restaurant has become one of Rome’s leading restaurants thanks to its personalised cuisine with influences from Lazio and elsewhere in Italy, with more traditional dishes served alongside recipes reinterpreted with imagination, flair and the occasional bold twist. The excellent wine list boasts around 3 600 labels (wines and spirits), including fine vintages and a good selection of wines by the glass.
