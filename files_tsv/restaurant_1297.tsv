Locanda Martinelli	piazza Mazzini 11	Nibbiaia	57016	Italy	€€	ModernCuisine	It’s well worth leaving the coast and climbing into the foothills to get to this small restaurant serving excellent cuisine. Housed in a rustic-style house with individual furnishings, in what could be the sitting room of a private house, the restaurant serves meat and fish specialities prepared with imagination from local produce and ingredients from further afield. As well as being a wine expert, the female owner gathers herbs, flowers and berries to flavour her recipes.	Air conditioning	Dinersclub, Mastercard, Visa	+39 0586 740161
