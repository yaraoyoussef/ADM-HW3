I Tenerumi	via Vulcanello	Isola Vulcano	98055	Italy	€€€€	Vegetarian,Creative	"We recommend arriving at this restaurant before the sun goes down so that you can enjoy the spectacular sunset over the Aeolian islands and the Faraglioni rocks. This is just a taster of the unique gastronomic experience that awaits, with dishes featuring on a long surprise tasting menu (there’s no choice) which is completely dedicated to vegetables and based on produce often grown on Vulcano. The roasted half onion served with its own fermented cream and flavoured with garlic and lemon is exceptional, as is the potato millefeuille served with a potato cream and abeurre blanc,all flavoured with chopped parsley stalks. 
Using techniques such as fermentation, marinating, oxidisation, smoking and many others, young chef Davide Guidara demonstrates real skill in adding flavour to vegetarian dishes that will leave a lasting memory and banish any nostalgia for meat. Dishes are accompanied by equally surprising drinks (including non-alcoholic options), with interesting cocktails created by a barman who often uses infusions made from the island’s herbs – we especially enjoyed those flavoured with sage, rosemary and peppermint. 
There’s a wine list dedicated exclusively to sparkling wines, plus a wider selection of almost 1000 labels (many from the region but also around the world) that is available on request. We particularly recommend the De Bartoli Terzavia , a fine sparkling wine made from Grillo grapes."
