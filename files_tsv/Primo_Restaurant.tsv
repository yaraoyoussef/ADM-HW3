Primo Restaurant	via 47° Reggimento Fanteria 7	Lecce	73100	Italy	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine,Contemporary	With just a few tables in a small room crowned by a typical vaulted ceiling in Lecce stone, this candle-lit restaurant is home to young chef Solaika Marrocco, who was born in 1995 in nearby Gallipoli. Here, she creates modern, highly personalised dishes which are not only a feast for the eyes but also for the palate. Despite her young age, this chef produces refined, elegantly simple cuisine which is never dull, and which often showcases ingredients from Puglia and the Salento. She also happily uses old traditional recipes to inspire her, creating her own bold, original and decidedly contemporary interpretations of traditional regional dishes.
