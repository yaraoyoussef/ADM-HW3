Charleston	via Generale Magliocco 19	Palermo	90141	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine,Creative	Before it became famous in Mondello, the renowned Charleston started out here in the centre of Palermo – and it has now returned to its origins, occupying the former Mazzara bar, itself once a favourite with locals. The ground floor is home to a café, cocktail bar and bistro, while the contemporary, Sicilian-style restaurant with an elegant summer terrace occupies the first floor (lift available). Here, young chef Gaetano Verde demonstrates all the skills acquired during his time working at renowned restaurants elsewhere in Italy and further afield. His dishes are clear and precise and often prepared using only three main ingredients – a good example is his grilled beef dish which is served with fermented grapes and sesame cream.
