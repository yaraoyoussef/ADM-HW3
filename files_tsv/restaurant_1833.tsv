Il Bavaglino	via dei Mille 2/b	Terrasini	90049	Italy	€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Although this restaurant now occupies new premises in an old building once used for salting fish, its style of cuisine (featured on three tasting menus, “Storie e passioni”, “Mura di Casa”, and the vegetarian “Erba Terra Foglie”, from which dishes can also be chosen à la carte style) remains unchanged. Inspired by regional traditions, chef Giuseppe Costa creates personalised and imaginative dishes that are influenced by local flavours and his past culinary experience, proving himself to be equally at ease with fish and meat options. Our inspector particularly recommends the local purple prawns, served raw with caviar and olives and a lemon and ginger coulis.
