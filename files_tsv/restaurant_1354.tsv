Līmū	via Ciro Scianna 177	Bagheria	90011	Italy	€€€	Creative,Sicilian	In a town renowned for its splendid villas built by the Palermo aristocracy, this restaurant occupies a small 16C tower on the edge of the historic centre. The name is a tribute to lemon, a fruit that grows in abundance in Bagheria. The restaurant has two elegant, contemporary-style floors, where dinner starts on the small terrace-cum-lounge – the setting for sampling a whole host of delicious appetisers. This is guests’ first encounter with the cuisine of Nino Ferreri, a skilled and creative chef who uses regional ingredients as the foundation for his imaginative recipes. The courteous and professional service is overseen by the talented Giandomenico Gambino.
