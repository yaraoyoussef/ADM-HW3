Osteria dal Moro	lungomare Spalato 74	Giulianova Lido	64021	Italy	€	CuisinefromAbruzzo,Seafood	A lively fish and seafood restaurant on the seafront, which is always busy thanks to its excellent value for money – booking ahead is highly recommended! Fish-based dishes only, all of which are announced at your table and which change regularly depending on market availability. The dishes are simple, rustic but full of flavour, which is why it’s easy to forgive the rather restricted choice of wine.	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	['Visa']	+39 085 800 4973	nan
