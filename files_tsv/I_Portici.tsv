I Portici	via dell'Indipendenza 69	Bologna	40121	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Occupying the atmospheric setting of the Eden theatre, a former late-19C musical café, this restaurant adorned with beautiful Liberty-style frescoes is the perfect backdrop for elegant, well-balanced Mediterranean-inspired dishes. Young, talented chef Nicola Annunziata offers three tasting menus of five, seven and nine courses (the latter a surprise menu), with wine pairings recommended by capable sommelier Riccardo Ricci. If you’re looking for a quieter and more romantic ambience, book a table in the 14C icehouse, with its glass floor providing glimpses of the well-stocked wine cellar below.
