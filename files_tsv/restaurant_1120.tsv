Vez	via Addolorata 7/9	San Marzano di San Giuseppe	74020	Italy	€€	ModernCuisine	Delicious modern cuisine based exclusively on local ingredients, including aromatic herbs from the property’s own small kitchen garden. One of the house specialities is the home-made stuffed pasta – a memory of the happy years that the chef spent in Bologna. Each dish is prepared with painstaking detail, resulting in decisive yet carefully orchestrated flavours. The restaurant, situated next to the church of San Carlo Borromeo in the village centre, boasts a spacious dining room with a vaulted ceiling and open-view kitchen, plus an outdoor terrace for alfresco dining in fine weather.
