Casa Perbellini 12 Apostoli	vicolo Corticella San Marco 3	Verona	37121	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Giancarlo Perbellini returns to his origins in this historic restaurant in his native city, where every chef from Verona (and possibly beyond) would like to work. The updated decor gives the restaurant even more appeal, as does the culinary style and philosophy showcased on three tasting menus: “Io e Silva”, which includes decidedly imaginative dishes (such as cooked and raw shellfish with a dash of soya and peppers) and is dedicated to his wife; “Io e Giorgio”, dedicated to his mentor and former restaurant owner, which features more classic recipes; and, last but not least, the completely vegetarian “L'Essenza”. Special mention must be made of the wine list, which includes an extensive selection of French labels, of which both the sommelier and Giancarlo are huge fans. As a final attraction, make sure you find time to visit the Roman ruins in the basement. We also highly recommend booking the chef's table where you can dine as a couple yet at the same time enjoy the company of the skilled chefs whom you’ll observe working together like the well-practised members of an orchestra – an extraordinary sight!
