Principe Cerami	piazza San Domenico 5	Taormina	98039	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine	The menu at this restaurant aims to return to the basic principles that lie behind chef Massimo Mantarro’s cuisine, namely the use of local and seasonal niche ingredients. Sicily boasts a bounty of produce full of different flavours and colours, taking guests on a journey from the coast to Mt Etna – as an example, vegetables (which dominate the menu) are grown around the volcano and are full of rich and intense flavours. In addition to the à la carte, guests can choose their own dishes from the “Principe Cerami” tasting menu, which includes fish and seafood from the Ionian alongside a few meat options. Although the wine list focuses on Sicily, it also includes some superb wines from elsewhere in Italy and around the world.
