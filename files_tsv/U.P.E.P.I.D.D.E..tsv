U.P.E.P.I.D.D.E.	vico Sant'Agnese 2	angolo corso Cavour	Ruvo di Puglia	70037	â‚¬	Apulian	Undeniably characteristic and refreshing! Dug out of the rock that once formed the old Aragonese walls, the four dining rooms in this restaurant run one into another under brick arches and then lead to the wine cellar, which is open to guests. The regional cuisine is as traditional as the decor, with specialities such as barbecued local meat and beef fillet in a plum sauce with wine and caramelised shallots on the menu.
