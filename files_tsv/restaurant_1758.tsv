With advice on hand from courteous female staff, choose from a selection of imaginative, locally influenced dishes that are full of flavour. We particularly recommend the pigeon (piccione di tutto un po’), accompanied by a glass of the potent Gamay del Trasimeno Opra red wine with an alcohol content of 14.5°!
