Il Colmetto	via Finilnuovo 9	Rodengo Saiano	25050	Italy	€€€	SeasonalCuisine,Farmtotable	A true gourmet agriturismo, Il Colmetto changes its menu almost week by week in line with the changing seasons. Full of flavour, the ingredients here (many of which are produced on the property, while others are sourced locally) are cooked with precision, avoiding overly fussy and complicated techniques. Instead, the focus is on good, honest cuisine with its roots in peasant traditions, in which the aim is to create comforting dishes that will appeal to the palate. The barbecued specialities, such as the sweetbreads and the excellent Jerusalem artichokes, are particularly delicious, while the superb goats’ milk butter, served soft and fluffy as a cloud with bread and focaccia, is truly delicious – its only drawback is that it can be addictive!
