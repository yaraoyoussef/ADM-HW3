Il Fenicottero Rosa Gourmet	via Emilia Ponente 23	Faenza	48018	Italy	€€€	Contemporary,Seafood	Situated within the Villa Abbondanzi luxury hotel, this restaurant is surrounded by a large park home to a flock of flamingos (fenicottero is the Italian for flamingo). Stylish and elegant dining rooms provide the backdrop for equally impressive cuisine, which is elaborate and full of imaginative touches. The same attention to detail is evident in the wine list, which includes several natural wines and from which the talented sommelier will find the perfect choice for you. We particularly enjoyed the Alto Adige Sauvignon Weingut In Der Eben: a rich and complex 2019 wine which was the perfect pairing for the entire meal, including dishes with real character.
