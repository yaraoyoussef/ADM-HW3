Re Maurì	via Benedetto Croce	Salerno	84121	Italy	€€€€	Creative	Situated in the Lloyd’s Baia hotel between Salerno and Vietri, in an elevated location overlooking the port, this restaurant offers splendid views of the bay from the floor-to-ceiling windows in the dining room which become even more stunning from the terrace where meals are served in fine weather. Specialities from Campania feature on the menu alongside dishes with a more international influence and ingredients from outside the region. Make sure you leave space for dessert: the cook worked as a pastry chef before coming here and the care he takes with his desserts is truly remarkable.
