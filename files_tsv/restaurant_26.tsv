Il Luogo Aimo e Nadia	via Montecuccoli 6	Milan	20147	Italy	€€€€	ItalianContemporary,ModernCuisine	This long-established restaurant has been part of the Milanese culinary scene for over 60 years and continues to attract food-lovers in search of top-quality cuisine today. It serves a generous tasting menu that showcases Italian cuisine in modern dishes, some inspired by the origins of the two dynamic chefs, Alessandro Negrini and Fabio Pisani (the former from Lombardy, the latter from Puglia). There’s also a menu dedicated to the seasons, where seasonal vegetables enhance the different dishes, while the “Omaggio a Milano” (Tribute to Milan – tortelli pasta stuffed with Fassona beef ossobuco and marrow in a Sardinian saffron and parmesan reduction) is always very popular. Make sure you allow plenty of time to peruse the extensive wine selection which is displayed on a tablet and includes some hard-to-find labels. The service is courteous and attentive throughout.
