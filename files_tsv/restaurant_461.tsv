San Baylon	via di Ripetta 232	Rome	00186	Italy	€€€	Contemporary	Not far from Piazza del Popolo and Rome’s most exclusive shopping streets, this restaurant is situated in the Palazzo Ripetta hotel, in what was once the refectory of a 17C convent. Today, the ambience here is more informal, with an almost bistro-like feel, while the cuisine is inspired by classic Italian dishes, including various grilled options among the main courses. Meals are served in the palazzo’s inner courtyard in fine weather.	Air conditioning, Terrace, Wheelchair access	Amex, Dinersclub, Mastercard, Visa	+39 06 322 2381	https://www.sanbaylon.com/
