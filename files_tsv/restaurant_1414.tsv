Locanda Pincelli	via Selva 52	Selva Malvezzi	40062	Italy	€€	Creative,Emilian	Named after the village’s former postman, an important and charismatic character in this small community, this former workers’ club is housed in a rustic restaurant with a beautiful porch where you sit in summer beneath cooling fans. The cuisine steps away from local tradition to offer creative yet never overly fanciful dishes which are always generous and beautifully presented. We particularly enjoyed the mezze maniche pasta with stewed white onion, sour butter and burnt lemon, as well as the leg of guinea fowl browned with paprika, its own juices and horseradish mayonnaise. When choosing your wine, you might like to ask owner Danilo for his recommendations from a list which is not extensive but is certainly interesting and carefully chosen.
