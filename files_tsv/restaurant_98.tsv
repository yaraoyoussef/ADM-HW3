Osteria Arborina	frazione Annunziata 27/b	La Morra	12064	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,Creative	Although the beautiful Arborina Relais boasts modern, stylish and elegant dining rooms, the main attraction here is the restaurant’s exciting cuisine in which different culinary styles and techniques are showcased in every dish. Inspiration comes from different influences – for example, we chose a menu inspired by the 1980s (a period when Neapolitan chef Fernando Tommaso Forino was not yet born), and particularly enjoyed the mullet in vodka and the dessert trolley. We also liked the idea behind the menu as a whole, namely the no-waste focus, with all parts of the ingredients used yet always with the aim of creating enjoyable dishes. An interesting, classically extensive wine list and excellent service complete the picture.
