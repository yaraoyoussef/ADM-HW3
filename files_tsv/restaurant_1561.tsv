Osteria de' Mercati	via Mercato 2	Sassari	7100	Italy	€€	MediterraneanCuisine,SeasonalCuisine	Slightly set back from the bustling streets of the historic centre yet still in the heart of the town, this delightful small restaurant is a recent addition to Sassari. It boasts a modern, elegant decor, friendly staff and a menu featuring carefully prepared fresh, seasonal dishes. Our inspector particularly recommends the seafood risotto. A choice of regional wines completes the picture.	['Air conditioning']	['Amex', 'Dinersclub', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 079 207 4486	nan
