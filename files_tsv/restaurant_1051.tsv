FRE	località San Sebastiano 68	Monforte d'Alba	12065	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Nestled among the vineyards of Réva resort less than 4km from the delightful village of Monforte d'Alba, you’ll find the FRE restaurant run by chef Francesco Marchese, who offers a perfect combination of sophisticated French techniques and fine ingredients from the Langhe. The dishes here are full of rich flavours, as demonstrated by the risotto in which an extraction of cured ham replaces the traditional broth; the dish is then topped with a parmesan and caviar bone marrow gratin. In fine weather, dine outdoors on the spectacular terrace overlooking the vineyards. More informal fare is served in the Piccolo FRE Bistrot.	Air conditioning, Car park, Interesting wine list, Terrace, Wheelchair access	Amex, Maestrocard, Mastercard, Visa	+39 0173 789269
