Cannavacciuolo Countryside	via Ticciano 137	Ticciano	80069	Italy	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine,ModernCuisine	This restaurant tells the story of chef Antonino Cannavacciuolo, who created this special place to reconnect with his childhood memories (his grandfather was once the caretaker here) and its sense of hospitality. This chef’s culinary philosophy is ably interpreted by resident chef Nicola Somma, who celebrates the region by combining ingredients from Cannavacciuolo’s adopted home with his native region in a journey that takes guests from northern to southern Italy. The ingredients used are carefully chosen and either sourced from local producers or grown in the restaurant’s own kitchen garden, keeping alive the precious traditions that have influenced this chef’s character and culinary skill. There’s an excellent and constantly expanding wine list, which will more than satisfy even the most demanding wine-buffs. An unforgettable, relaxing gourmet experience in a bucolic setting.
