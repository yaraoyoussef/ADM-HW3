Maeba Restaurant	contrada Serra 29	Ariano Irpino	83031	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary	This charming restaurant is built on the site of an old 18C olive oil mill (part of which is still used as a convivial wine cellar) in a secluded and tranquil location. The rest of the building is modern, elegant and colourful, while the delightful outdoor space boasts a garden overlooking the surrounding hills and olive trees. Since early 2024, a former sous-chef here has returned to take over at the helm in the kitchen, where he creates dishes that mirror the modern simplicity of the setting. He offers a carefully prepared blind tasting menu (booking ahead is mandatory and you choose your number of courses when you book) that focuses on local ingredients and makes ample use of vegetables.
