Sarri	lungomare C. Colombo 108	Borgo Prino	Imperia	18100	€€€	Seafood,ModernCuisine	This attractive restaurant boasts a beautiful location in the charming Borgo Prino, a row of houses facing the sea and painted in the pastel shades typical of the region. Liguria’s legendary mild climate means that meals can often be enjoyed outdoors, but if that’s not an option there’s also a charming dining room in an old warehouse decorated in impeccable contemporary style. The faultless, elegant service here is overseen with skill and charm by the chef’s wife, Alessandra. We’ve left the real reason for our enthusiasm until last: owner-chef Andrea Sarri delights guests with his superb cuisine, which features top-quality fish and seafood from the Ligurian Sea, as well as seasonal vegetables and beansprouts grown in organic gardens, all of which result in highly original dishes such as the “vertical” raw fish or the shellfish from Oneglia cooked in a stew with aromatic herbs.
