The welcoming dining room here provides the backdrop for modern Italian cuisine prepared with carefully chosen ingredients which are sourced, where possible, from small-scale local and zero-mile producers. Mouthwatering Colonnata lardo is often served with the delicious bread, which includes rice- and chestnut-flour options. The excellent service adds to this pleasant gourmet dining experience in the town of Prato.	['Air conditioning']	['Amex', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0574 182 0222	http://www.pacaristorante.it
