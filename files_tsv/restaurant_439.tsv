Osteria La Sangiovesa	piazza Simone Balacchi 14	Santarcangelo di Romagna	47822	Italy	€	CuisinefromRomagna,TraditionalCuisine	This simple and informal inn is the perfect setting in which to get together with friends, sitting around small tables laden withpiadineflatbreads and slices of ham and salami. There’s also a restaurant here – a network of small rooms laid out in the cellars of an old palazzo – where portraits of local historical characters can be made out in the subtle lighting. Here too, the cuisine is inspired by the region and its traditions, with top-quality ingredients (cured hams, meat, oil, wine, vermouth etc) all coming from the restaurant’s own farm and estate.
