Frades Porto Cervo	via Giuseppe Mazzini 20	Milan	20123	Italy	€€€	Sardinian,ModernCuisine	This new Milan venture is the brainchild of three brothers who already run a restaurant and delicatessen in Porto Cervo. Elegant and extremely contemporary in style, the restaurant serves modern Sardinian cuisine, while a corner reminiscent of their delicatessen allows guests to taste the island’s hams and cheeses by the slice.
