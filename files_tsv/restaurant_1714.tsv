Osteria de l'Umbreleèr	via Mazzini 13	Cicognolo	26030	Italy	€€	Lombardian	Situated in Cicognolo in the Lower Po valley, where early morning mists create an evocative atmosphere in autumn, this traditional restaurant with a rustic feel serves specialities from Lombardy with a focus on delicious starters and top-quality meat. Our inspector particularly recommends the white onion gratin soup and the Burgundy-style snails. A simpler menu is available at lunchtime and there’s a small garden for alfresco dining on summer evenings.	Air conditioning, Terrace	Mastercard, Visa	+39 0372 830509	https://umbreleer.it/
