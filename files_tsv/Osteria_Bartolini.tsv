Osteria Bartolini	piazza Malpighi 16	Bologna	40123	Italy	€	Seafood	This young, attractive and friendly restaurant brings the maritime influences of Romagna to Bologna, upholding its traditions of fresh fish dishes which are simple yet full of flavour. “Fritto misto” (fried fish) is still the house speciality, although other classic fish and seafood dishes also feature on the menu. In fine weather, enjoy your meal in the shade of a huge century-old plane tree.
