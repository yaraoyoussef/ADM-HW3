Terramira	piazza della Vittoria 13	Capolona	52010	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary,Tuscan	Having gained valuable experience elsewhere, the Scapecchi brothers are now back in Arezzo, where their restaurant offers views of the River Arno from its beautiful and softly lit dining room. Here, two tasting menus (from which guests are free to exchange dishes if they wish) showcase the region’s seasonal ingredients in modern dishes which are precise and yet full of distinctive and authentic flavours. Particular mention must be made of the pigeon served with sauces and seasonal vegetables, a dish in which chef Filippo demonstrates all that he learned from master-chef Gaetano Trovato at Arnolfo di Colle in Val d'Elsa. An excellent wine list completes the picture.	['Air conditioning', 'Great view']	['Amex', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0575 420989	https://terramira.it
