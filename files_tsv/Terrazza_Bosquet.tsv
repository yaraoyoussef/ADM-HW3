Terrazza Bosquet	piazza Tasso 34	Sorrento	80067	Italy	€€€€	Creative	In the heart of Sorrento, a delightful garden leads like a long corridor up to the entrance of the Excelsior Vittoria, one of the most iconic hotels on the Sorrentine peninsula, where this gourmet restaurant sets out its tables on a panoramic terrace as soon as the weather allows (otherwise, guests eat indoors). Here, chef Antonino Montefusco prepares various tasting menus (including a vegetarian option) with dishes inspired by recipes and ingredients from Campania, all reinterpreted with an elegant, aesthetic touch. There’s an extensive wine list, including an excellent choice of wines by the glass.
