Manuelina	via Roma 296	Recco	16036	Italy	€€	Ligurian,ModernCuisine	Very few restaurants in Liguria can compete with the long gastronomic tradition of this restaurant, which was named after its original owner back in 1885! It was Manuelina herself who made the typical focaccia of Recco famous, offering it as a dish in her tavern. The fourth generation of the family now runs the business with the same passion and enthusiasm – part of the building houses the typical Focacceria, where family traditions are kept alive, while the other is home to the restaurant itself (even here the legendary and highly recommended focaccia is on the menu) with its round tables. The cuisine is traditional yet with modern touches and based on Ligurian ingredients with a focus on fish (although meat also features).
