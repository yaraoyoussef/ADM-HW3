La Madia	corso Filippo Re Capriata 22	Licata	92027	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Sicilian	Park in one of the streets near this restaurant and prepare yourself for a delightful journey through Sicily and its culinary traditions! Chef Pino Cuttaia, who is demonstrably in love with his native island, highlights his ingredients in a simple and unfussy way. He uses contemporary techniques, such as in the extremely light mozzarella and tomato dish served at the beginning of the meal, as well as more traditional methods evident in the black Nebrodi suckling pig served with a tomato-based “sugo della Domenica” (Sunday gravy). The two small dining rooms with a modern and minimalist feel offer an attractive setting for this enjoyable culinary experience. Wine-enthusiasts will appreciate the interesting selection of labels (including large bottles popular with connoisseurs). We recommend the 2019 Baglio Cristo di Campobello Adènzia, a red wine with earthy notes and delightful finesse.
