Alla Fassa	via Nascimbeni 11	Castelletto di Brenzone	37010	Italy	€€	Seafood,ItalianContemporary	Although the beautiful views of the lake (with only a cycle path between the restaurant and the water) and mountains on the opposite shore can be admired from the dining room, in fine weather it’s a race for the outdoor tables just a few metres from the water. The cuisine is as impressive as the setting, with a fine balance of classic and modern dishes featuring fish from the lake (such as the “il lago in un piatto” – the lake in a dish – starter) and the sea. A few guestrooms with views of the lake are also available.	Car park, Great view, Terrace, Wheelchair access	Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 045 743 0319	https://www.ristoranteallafassa.com
