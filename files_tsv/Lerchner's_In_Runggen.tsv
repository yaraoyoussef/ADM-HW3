Lerchner's In Runggen	frazione Ronchi 3/a	Saint Lorenzen	39030	Italy	€€	SouthTyrolean,SeasonalCuisine	Typical of the Alto Adige and situated right next to its own farm from where the beef on its menu is sourced, this restaurant pays careful attention to detail both in its decor (the staff wear local costume) and in its delicious regional cuisine, which is made from the best local ingredients. The house specialities change with the seasons and include geröstl (grilled beef and pork with potatoes, onions and speck ham), tirtlan (rye pancakes), and the unmissable apple strudel. The Alto Adige region also takes centre-stage on the wine list.
