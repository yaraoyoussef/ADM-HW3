Andrea Larossa	via Sabaudia 4	Turin	10133	Italy	€€€€	ItalianContemporary	Chef Andrea Larossa, a real connoisseur of the ingredients and tradition of Piedmont but equally at ease with more creative cuisine, is at the helm at this restaurant, where a large dining room is the setting for friendly, courteous and professional service. The tasting menus reflect the spirit of the chef’s cuisine, from the more regionally focused (albeit partly reinterpreted) option to a more imaginative menu which combines influences from all over Italy and even further afield. There’s a surprise menu for guests who prefer to rely on choices made by the chef himself.
