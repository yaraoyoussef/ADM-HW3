Da Lucio	viale Ortigara 80	Rimini	47921	Italy	€€€	Seafood,Contemporary	"The focus at this restaurant, named after the son of one of the partners, is on fish, fish and more fish! Lucio serves the best-quality fish, which is dry aged and then cooked (often over the charcoal grill) or served raw. The wine list pays particular attention to “natural” wines. The word ""Trattoria"" in the restaurant name is intended to convey a sense of the friendly, welcoming ambience and informal service here."
