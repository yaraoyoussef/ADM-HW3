Retroscena	largo del Teatro 3	Porto San Giorgio	63822	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	One of the most interesting Michelin-starred restaurants in the region. Situated among houses with brick façades in Porto San Giorgio’s charming historic centre, this restaurant has just a few tables in an elegant, minimalist-style dining room. When focusing on their food, the attention of guests will be also drawn to the open-view kitchen, where the team led by Richard Abou Zaki prepares remarkable and often exciting dishes. Although this young yet highly experienced chef’s cuisine reveals influences from his time spent in Modena, for the most part his dishes are original, personalised and imaginative.
