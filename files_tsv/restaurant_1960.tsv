Un Piano nel Cielo	via Capriglione 147	Praiano	84010	Italy	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine,Contemporary	A delightful panoramic lift leads from the Casa Angelina hotel to this restaurant where, in fine weather, meals are served on the candlelit terrace with its breathtaking views of the coast. Chef Leopoldo Elefante creates Mediterranean cuisine with a focus on fish and seafood, including his signature dentex (a kind of sea bream) – a classic dish with a light modern touch featuring baked Tyrrhenian fish escalope served on diced potatoes and cherry tomatoes with a clam sauce. The menu also includes a few excellent meat specialities. The chef here takes great care with presentation, arranging each ingredient on the plate with attentive precision while also working quickly in order to ensure that dishes are served at the right temperature. He is ably assisted by a friendly and attentive team front of house, where an impressive wine list of over 1 000 labels will delight wine-lovers, especially those keen on French and Italian sparkling wines.
