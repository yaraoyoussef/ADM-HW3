La Tana Gourmet	via Kaberlaba 19	Asiago	36012	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Once a mountain refuge, the red house that overlooks this plateau is now home to one of the most interesting and avant-garde gourmet restaurants in Italy. Founder Alessandro Dal Degan, who offers a long surprise tasting menu (a culinary voyage, as he calls it), will take you on a journey through his beloved mountains, the Adriatic and beyond. Entrust yourself to his care in a spirit of curiosity and openness and prepare to explore new horizons. Dishes often include combinations that will sound unusual to you, but instead of picking these apart and thinking about the individual components, try to savour their complex, contrasting and yet harmonious flavours. As a result, this new and extraordinary experience will introduce you to some remarkable and occasionally unforgettable dishes. In addition to the musical backdrop (which provides the perfect soundtrack to the cuisine), special mention should be made of the wine pairings that come courtesy of business partner Enrico Maglio, who oversees the carefully researched and surprising wine list. The partnership with various local suppliers, which helps to showcase the region’s produce, is also highly commendable.
