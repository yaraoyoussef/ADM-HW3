Cannavacciuolo Vineyard	via del Teatro 8	Casanova di Terricciola	56030	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary	The famous talented chef Antonino Cannavacciuolo has opened one of his Laqua resorts in a lesser-known part of Tuscany that boasts charming verdant landscapes. The resort occupies part of the fully renovated small hamlet, where the comfortable contemporary-style decor in the restaurant is echoed by the precise modern cuisine, which is skilfully presented and perfectly balanced between flavour and elegance. Guests can admire the almost surgical precision of resident chef Marco Suriano as he finishes the dishes in the open-view kitchen. The service is equally impressive, with a team trained by professional staff boasting plenty of experience at home and abroad. The resort also has spacious, comfortable apartments available, with breakfast served in your room.
