Storie d'Amore	via Desman 418	Borgoricco	35010	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine	This small, welcoming restaurant in the province of Padova is run by its two owners, one at the helm in the kitchen, the other overseeing the warm and beautifully decorated dining room. The cuisine is complex and elaborate rather than minimalist, with chef Davide Filippetto either creating different dishes from the same ingredient or preparing different ingredients in imaginative combinations. An abundant and generous menu, which includes an extensive wine list.
