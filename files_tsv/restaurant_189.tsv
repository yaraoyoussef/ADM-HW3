La Cascina 1899	strada statale 106	Rocella Jonica	89047	Italy	€€	Calabrian,ClassicCuisine	Situated on the main road running alongside the sea, this pleasant restaurant with a large car park occupies a late-19C building that has been transformed into an attractive, rustic-style eatery with plenty of outdoor areas and air-conditioned rooms with exposed-stone walls and wooden ceilings that provide welcome respite from the heat of summer. It’s no surprise that fish and seafood take pride of place on the menu, although meat dishes also feature. The shop next door sells regional specialities, some produced by the restaurant itself, including the famous local bergamot citrus fruit.
