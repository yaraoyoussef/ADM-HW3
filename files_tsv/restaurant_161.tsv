Osteria la Fontanina	portichetti Fontanelle Santo Stefano 3	Verona	37129	Italy	€€	ClassicCuisine,Italian	Situated just a stone’s throw from the Roman Theatre and Ponte Pietra, Osteria La Fontanina is one of Verona’s oldest restaurants with a history that dates back over 200 years. The restaurant has a “bohemian” feel, with old mirrors, prints, silverware and plants that combine well with the subdued lighting (even at lunchtime) and just about enough space for the small tables. The cuisine showcases Italian and regional flavours, while the impressive wine list focuses on red wine vintages from the Verona region.
