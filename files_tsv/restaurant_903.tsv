Agritur El Mas	strada de Saslonch 176	località Col de Soldai	Moena	38035	€€	RegionalCuisine,Alpine	Situated above the village, this authentic agriturismo raises cows, horses and pigs and produces its own meat, salamis and cheeses, all of which are available online and in its own shop. Other Ladin-inspired specialities from the valley also feature on the menu and are served in an attractive dining room adorned with a profusion of old wood and an open brazier in the middle of the room. While in other restaurants an open-view kitchen may add interest to the dining room, here guests can enjoy views of the cows in their stalls behind a glass screen. Pleasant guestrooms with a focus on “green” construction methods are available in the same building.
