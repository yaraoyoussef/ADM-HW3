Taverna del Capitano	piazza delle Sirene 10/11	Marina del Cantone	80061	Italy	€€€€	Creative	A series of hairpin bends lead downhill to Marina del Cantone, one of the most beautiful beaches on this stretch of coastline, situated in a romantic bay sheltered by the Tre Pizzi promontory. Here, you’ll find the Taverna del Capitano, where the Casa Caputo dining room near the entrance serves simple, traditional cuisine, while the Michelin-starred gourmet restaurant boasts a rooftop setting where guests dine overlooking the beach with the sound of the waves as a backdrop. In the open-view kitchen behind the tables, Alfonso Caputo prepares dishes based on local fish, as well as the occasional meat option, all of which have a Mediterranean flavour and a focus on the region’s extraordinary ingredients.
