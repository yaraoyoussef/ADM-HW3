Il Ristorante Alain Ducasse Napoli	Via Cristoforo Colombo 45	Naples	80133	Italy	€€€€	Creative,MediterraneanCuisine	Alain Ducasse, one of the great names in contemporary fine dining, has arrived in Naples, opening this restaurant in the former premises of the prestigious Ristorante Il Comandante. Situated on the 9th floor of the Romeo hotel overlooking the port, the restaurant boasts fine views of Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples, especially at sunset when the colours are truly spectacular. Meanwhile, the modern dining room, decorated completely in black, is equally as stunning as its surroundings. Alessandro Lucassino, who was born in 1991 and has years of experience working with his mentor, adds a personal flavour to local recipes: by using short cooking times, he preserves the nutritious qualities and flavours of local fish and vegetables while remaining faithful to Ducasse’s “cuisine de la naturalité” philosophy.
