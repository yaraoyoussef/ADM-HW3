Zash	SP 2 I/II 60	Archi	95018	Italy	€€€€	Creative	Once through the entrance gate, make your way through an orchard planted with citrus trees to get to this restaurant occupying a charming, carefully restored 19C “palmento” (a building once used for fermenting wine) that has retained its magical and romantic atmosphere. Here, Giuseppe Raciti’s top-quality cuisine is showcased on themed tasting menus from which dishes can also be chosen à la carte. The chef’s recipes are full of references to the island, as well as personal influences which he describes as “ricordi, viaggi, esperienze” (memories, travels, experiences). Elegant guestrooms dotted around the property add to the appeal of this truly idyllic property.
