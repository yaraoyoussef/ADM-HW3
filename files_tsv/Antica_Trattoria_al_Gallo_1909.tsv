Antica Trattoria al Gallo 1909	via Maggiore 87	Ravenna	48121	Italy	€€	Italian,ClassicCuisine	"It is an unavoidable reference point in the gastronomic panorama of Ravenna and, as a matter of fact, it is almost always full! An ""Historical Establishment of Italy"", and rightly so considering that it has been run by the same family for over 100 years, this restaurant is a trattoria only in its name, given the blaze of art nouveau decorations inside. As regards the cuisine, you can expect regional dishes: truffles, succulent meats and local fish. In the dining room everyone is involved, while the young owner will illustrate the wine selection with the typically delightful congeniality of Romagna."
