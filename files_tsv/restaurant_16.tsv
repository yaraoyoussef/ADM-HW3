Quattro Passi	via Vespucci 13/n	Marina del Cantone	80061	Italy	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine,Contemporary	This restaurant’s 40-year history began with present owner-chef Fabrizio Mellino’s grandfather, who ran a small business selling eggs from his own hens. From this, he decided to branch out and open a pizzeria “four steps from the sea” (hence the name Quattro Passi), which over the years his son Antonio and now his grandson Fabrizio have transformed into a temple to Mediterranean cuisine. Flavours, strong technique and quality ingredients combine to create an exciting feast for the tastebuds which finishes with a selection of small chocolate eggs with unusual flavours such as roquefort, rocket, chilli pepper and lemon. A host of different influences (the sea, the Sannio region, France, Japan) and ingredients (San Marzano tomatoes, Amalfi lemons) come together in Fabrizio’s cuisine, resulting in dishes that are simple, delicious and full of flavour. It’s not an easy journey to Marina del Cantone, but once here you’ll be warmly welcomed by Raffaele and his team, after which you can sit back and enjoy a truly memorable dining experience.
