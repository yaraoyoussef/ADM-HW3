Zia	via Goffredo Mameli 45	Rome	00153	Italy	€€€€	Innovative	A young chef of undoubted talent is at the helm of this restaurant situated behind the busier, more tourist-frequented streets of Trastevere. The chef in question is Antonio Ziantoni (hence the name of the restaurant), who creates imaginative cuisine that is nonetheless based on solid classic foundations – this gives his dishes structure, solidity and real appeal, as well as full and rounded flavours. One of the most interesting Michelin-starred restaurants in Rome.
