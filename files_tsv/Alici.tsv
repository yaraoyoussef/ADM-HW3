Alici	via Giovanni Augustariccio 33	Amalfi	84011	Italy	€€€€	Campanian,Contemporary	"Alici is the fine-dining restaurant at Borgo Santandrea, a beautiful luxury hotel situated just outside the village of Conca dei Marini on the Amalfi Coast, where both the hotel and restaurant represent the best of Italian style. The dining room is furnished with vintage-style decor, although meals are nearly always served on the magnificent terrace which boasts fanciful majolica tiles in shades of azure that echo the colours of the sea and sky. Chef Crescenzo Scotti is fond of beautiful places, having previously worked in Ravello and, before that, at a Michelin-starred restaurant on the island of Vulcano. Here, he returns to his favourite region with skill and craftsmanship, focusing on the flavours of the Amalfi Coast as well as Naples and his native Ischia, while always adding a touch of fantasy to his dishes. He reinterprets a typical dish from Praiano (""Totano e patate alla praianese"") by including interesting personal touches such squid in a tomato sauce, fried squid meatballs and raw squid, while the excellent Gragnano pasta, cooked with partly melted potatoes to create a delicious cream, is added at your table. It is then left to the guest to mix everything together to create a truly delicious dish."
