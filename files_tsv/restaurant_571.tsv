Il Buco	II rampa Marina Piccola 5	Sorrento	80067	Italy	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine,ModernCuisine	Situated in the centre of Sorrento, this restaurant boasts a historic dining room housed in the 16C cellars of an old monastery, as well as a more contemporary-style room with an open-view wine cellar that displays an impressive selection of more than 1 600 different bottles. Wherever you choose to sit, you’ll enjoy cuisine influenced by the culinary traditions of Campania, albeit with a few imaginative touches. Chef Giuseppe Aversa’s first courses deserve a particular mention, especially the linguine with lemon-marinated scorpion fish, bottarga and dried tomatoes, and the gnocchi on a Neapolitan ragù with basil pesto and salted ricotta cream.
