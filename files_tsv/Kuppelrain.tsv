Kuppelrain	via Stazione 16	località Maragno	Castelbello	39020	€€€	Farmtotable,ModernCuisine	The many positive adjectives that can be used to describe the Trafoier family can be summed up by simply saying that they are unique! Their individual talents come together in the natural and engaging welcome they offer guests, demonstrating a warmth and professionalism that is typical of the Kuppelrain experience. Chef Kevin, who is as skilful as his father Jorg (now front of house), demonstrates precise, excellent techniques in his search for comforting and appealing flavours that bring out the full flavour of his ingredients with no frills or unnecessary fuss. Local produce takes pride of place, such as fruit and vegetables from the restaurant’s own kitchen garden, and meat and fish from the region. The desserts, as well as the imaginative pralines, are made by daughter Natalie. Wine-enthusiasts will also be in their element here, thanks to the excellent wine list (including a fine selection by the glass, as well as magnums and 3-litre double magnums) which is overseen by talented Sonya (the winner of the 2022 Michelin Sommelier Award!), who creates unique wine pairings. Bistro service only at lunchtime.	['Car park', 'Great view', 'Interesting wine list', 'Terrace', 'Wheelchair access']	['Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0473 624103	https://www.kuppelrain.com/it/ristorante
