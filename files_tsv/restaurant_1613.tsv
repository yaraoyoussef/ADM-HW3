Oltremare	via Diego Taiani 3	Maiori	84010	Italy	€€€	Contemporary,Creative	Situated on the fifth floor of the Due Torri hotel, the restaurant has recently been refurbished, giving it an even more charming and atmospheric feel than before. The cuisine is creative in style, almost always using ingredients and recipes from Campania as its inspiration – a good example is the many different ways tomato is used, including tomato water distilled in an alembic still. Chef Alfonso Crisci’s recipes are complex and always full of different ingredients and colours, with a selection of delicious and generous desserts to finish your meal.
