La Brinca	via Campo di Ne 58	Ne	16040	Italy	€€	Ligurian,TraditionalCuisine	This trattoria run by the Circella family – without doubt one of the best in Italy – has been delighting guests since 1987. The menu features dishes and ingredients that are generous, full of flavour and strongly rooted in the region, including “dishes of the year” which go back to 2010. The superb wine cellar boasts a selection of over 1 000 labels, including some rare bottles, for which sommelier Matteo received Michelin’s Best Sommelier in Italy award in 2021. To sum up, this is the sort of restaurant that everyone would like in their neighbourhood!
