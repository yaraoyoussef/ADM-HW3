Luisl Stube	via Venosta 4	Algund	39022	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Schlosswirt Forst is a typical 16C residence that is home to a traditional restaurant, a few guestrooms and the Luisl Stube, a small gem boasting the beautiful old wood and traditional chandeliers of a historic Stube, with more candles than tables (of which there are just four) creating a timeless, intimate and truly romantic atmosphere. In contrast, the cuisine is contemporary in style, prepared by chef Luis Haller, who carefully searches out local produce which he serves alongside a few more exotic ingredients, as well as fish and seafood, on his two tasting menus. Talented sommelier Nicola Spimpolo delights guests with his exceptional wine pairings, exploring old vintages in his constant quest for superb, high-quality labels.
