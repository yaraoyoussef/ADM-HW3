Verso Capitaneo	piazza del Duomo 21	Milan	20121	Italy	€€€€	Creative,MediterraneanCuisine	The two Capitaneo brothers, united by their passion for cuisine yet with very different characters, have opened this restaurant in Piazza Duomo following years of experience working in Michelin-starred restaurants. In this informal ambience, guests have the option of dining either at black glass tables or at large benches arranged around the kitchen, from where they can observe the entertaining sight of the chef at work in the kitchen. The cuisine focuses on extremely fresh, top-quality ingredients showcased using unfussy techniques that put flavour centre stage. Exciting dishes include the blue lobster with yellow courgettes and the house “welcome” snack – an intriguing rose of beetroot petals and caviar, the latter one of the restaurant’s most featured posts on Instagram.
