L'Ambasciata	piazzetta Ambasciatori del Gusto 1	Quistello	46026	Italy	€€€	Mantuan,ItalianContemporary	This has long been one of those restaurants in Italy where the opulent interior decor has no equal – at Christmas, the mirrors, rugs, silverware, chandeliers and piles of books are joined by the largest and most ornate Christmas tree that you’ll ever see in a restaurant. The cuisine created by owner-chef Matteo Ugolotti is inspired by Mantuan traditions and the restaurant’s previous famous owners, occasionally going all the way back to the Renaissance. Special mention should be made of the extraordinary chocolate salami – a dessert coated with a delicious, frothy, warm zabaglione poured from a copper pan at your table. The menu also features more modern recipes and tasting menus.	['Air conditioning', 'Car park']	['Amex', 'Dinersclub', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0376 619169	https://www.ristorantelambasciata.eu/
