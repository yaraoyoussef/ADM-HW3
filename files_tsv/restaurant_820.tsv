Punto G	via Gian Francesco Parravicini 34	Monza	20900	Italy	€€€	Contemporary	Situated not far from the town centre, this restaurant has two different spaces – a ground-floor bistro, plus a gourmet dining room on the first floor, both beautifully maintained and decorated with simple elegance. Here, a young chef from Campania who has experience working both in Italy and abroad creates modern, elegant and contemporary cuisine. In the bistro, the choice of gourmet pizzas is a reminder of the chef’s origins.	['Air conditioning']	['Amex', 'Maestrocard', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 039 321592	https://www.ristorantepuntog.com
