Unterwirt	Gudon 45	Gudon	39043	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,MediterraneanCuisine	Occupying a private house, this restaurant boasts a couple of old Stube-style dining rooms, one of which is highly romantic and dates back to the 13C – although it looks as though the vintage wood may have come from elsewhere, it has in fact all been here for centuries. The owner-chef creates carefully thought-out dishes which combine precision and classic comfort with the occasional modern touch, harmoniously combining the flavours of the Alto Adige with Mediterranean influences, with a particular focus on fish. A welcoming outdoor terrace for summer dining completes the picture.	Car park, Garden or park, Terrace	Mastercard, Visa	+39 338 385 4015
