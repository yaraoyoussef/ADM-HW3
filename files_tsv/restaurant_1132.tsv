Il Barolino	via Giovanni XXIII 110	Carpi	41012	Italy	€€	Emilian,TraditionalCuisine	The friendliness and Emilian genuineness of the Barolo brothers and of the whole team cheers a break here where you can enjoy the authentic regional cuisine. Parmesan cream tortellini are a must: large portions and top quality of these little pasta bundles still strictly made by hand! The room is simple and suitable above all for informal meetings among friends and colleagues.
