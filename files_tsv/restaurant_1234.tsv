Magazzino 52	via Giolitti 52/a	Turin	10123	Italy	€€	ItalianContemporary	This restaurant with characteristic brick-vaulted ceilings has retained the feel of its previous role as a warehouse. Despite the limited choice of dishes on the menu here, there is a strong focus on top-quality ingredients with recipes inspired by the Piedmont as well as the sea. The bottles of wine on display on its shelves can be purchased to take away. All-in-all, an excellent address in one of the city’s most elegant districts.
