SOMS	via Piave 61	Pescara	65122	Italy	€€	CuisinefromAbruzzo,Contemporary	Situated in a pedestrianised area of the old town, the historic “società operaia di mutuo soccorso” (SOMS – a workers’ mutual aid association) has been transformed into a bright, welcoming restaurant where the chef creates dishes influenced by the traditions of the Abruzzi yet decidedly original in style (barbecued dishes are one of the specialities). Classic decor, plus a pleasant outdoor space for alfresco dining in summer.
