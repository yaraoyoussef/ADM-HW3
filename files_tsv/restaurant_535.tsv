Lido 84	corso Zanardelli 196	Fasano del Garda	25083	Italy	€€€€	Creative	Once you’ve left your car in the car park, a slight descent leads to this small corner of paradise boasting one of the most beautiful views of Lake Garda. Run by two brothers (one in the kitchen, the other front of house), this elegant restaurant is striking for its many decorative details. The cuisine here is full of flavour, with generous portions that give the impression that every meal at Lido 84 is Sunday lunch – joyous, festive and served in a relaxed and informal atmosphere. There’s also plenty of contact with the chefs, who often bring the dishes to the tables themselves. For a special occasion, we recommend booking the table in the small stone building in the splendid garden, with its classic decor and breathtaking views.
