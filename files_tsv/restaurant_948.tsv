Iris Ristorante	Via Leoni 10	Verona	37121	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary,ItalianContemporary	Not far from the 12C Basilica di San Fermo, this restaurant is housed in the Palazzo Soave (formerly Palazzo Malaspina Bottagisio). This historic address boasts highly elegant rooms with the “fishbone”-style stonework typical of Roman buildings and vaulted ceilings that provide a pleasant contrast to the restaurant’s contemporary furnishings. Your meal begins a journey back through the city’s history, as appetisers are served in their own special setting in the palazzo’s 14C wine cellar which has Roman origins, after which you return to the dining room to enjoy the rest of your meal. The talented chef here creates regionally influenced, balanced and imaginative dishes with a “green” focus. The menu also features fish, especially from the Adriatic, while the wine list boasts over 800 labels with a particular emphasis on France and the Veneto.
