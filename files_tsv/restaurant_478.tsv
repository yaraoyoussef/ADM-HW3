Madonnina del Pescatore	via Lungomare Italia 11	Marzocca	60019	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	It’s now forty years since the Madonnina opened in 1984, yet chef Moreno Cedroni has not lost the creative touch that has resulted in him becoming one of the most influential chefs of his generation. Year after year, eating at La Madonnina remains a novelty: the menu succeeds like no other in reflecting past traditions and future culinary trends, especially in its fish and seafood dishes, and new dishes are added regularly, often having been researched in the laboratory next to the restaurant using specialised food technology. There are two tasting menus available: “Ricordi d'infanzia & Mariella 1984-2024” featuring chef Cedroni’s great classic dishes, and “Luca e Moreno... Il Viaggio di Marco Polo” which includes dishes with an Asian and Middle Eastern influence. The chef’s wife Mariella oversees the excellent service front of house, while this wonderful couple’s commitment to their cuisine is also demonstrated by their vegetable garden situated almost right on the beach, which provides vegetables infused with the salty sea air – a brilliant idea that represents their strong connection to the land. The wine list features a popular selection of French sparkling wines.
