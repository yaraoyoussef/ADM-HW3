Dolce Stil Novo alla Reggia	piazza della Repubblica 4	Venaria Reale	10078	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary	It could be said that this restaurant boasts a regal setting, given that its entrance stands in the inner courtyard of the Reggia di Venaria, the spectacular former residence of the House of Savoy. You then take the lift to the fourth floor and the restaurant’s dining room, elegantly furnished in 1950-60s style, and a summer terrace overlooking the garden. The cuisine here is centred around superb ingredients grown in the valleys of Piedmont, and occasionally further afield in the region and beyond, and is showcased in dishes that combine tradition and creativity.
