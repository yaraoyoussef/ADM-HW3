La Loggia Bistrò	Corte Sgarzarie 7	Verona	37121	Italy	€€€	Contemporary,RegionalCuisine	Slightly off the beaten track yet still in the town centre, this restaurant boasts a courtyard setting for summer dining plus an intimate interior room with just a few small square tables, subtle lighting and an attractive decor featuring old wine bottles. A far cry from the classic tourist fare often available elsewhere, the cuisine served here is imaginatively presented with a focus on the use of seasonal ingredients.
