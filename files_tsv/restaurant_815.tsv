Nana Piccolo Bistrò	via Giosuè Carducci 19	Senigallia	60019	Italy	€€	ModernCuisine,International	Spanish influences are evident in the cuisine served at this lively restaurant situated in the heart of this bustling town. After years spent working in Spain, the owner-chef has returned to Senigallia where he delights guests with dishes such as Iberian carbonara (made with Pata Negra ham and Manchego cheese) and potato and salted cod omelette. In high season, it’s best to book ahead and maybe even get here early to avoid parking problems – you can always work up an appetite with a stroll through Senigallia’s beautiful historic centre. Young, friendly and efficient female staff add to the appeal.	Terrace	Mastercard, Visa	+39 071 64999	https://www.nanapiccolobistro.it
