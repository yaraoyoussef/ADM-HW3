Pomiroeu	via Garibaldi 37	Seregno	20831	Italy	€€€	Creative	This restaurant, one of the finest in the region, is run by its owner Giancarlo Morelli and celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2023. Situated in the centre of Seregno, the restaurant is intimate and welcoming with walls adorned with beautiful works of contemporary art thanks to the restaurant’s partnership with a local art gallery. The cuisine here is modern yet unfussy and the chef is equally at ease with meat, fish and vegetable dishes. One of the few restaurants around Monza to still offer a cheese course!
