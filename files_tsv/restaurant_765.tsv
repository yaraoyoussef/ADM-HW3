Campiello	via Nazionale 46	San Giovanni al Natisone	33048	Italy	€€	Seafood	Although the homemade breadsticks and preserves (available for purchase) at this long-established restaurant should not be missed, Campiello’s highlights are its fish and wine – the fish served here is among the best in the region. We highly recommend the fish soup served with shellfish and a Buzara sauce, while the wine cellar is home to a selection of 25 000 bottles, with wines from the nearby Collio and Colli Orientali vineyards taking centre stage. A selection of renowned labels from Italy and abroad also features, offering an incredible choice of the highest quality for wine connoisseurs. There’s also the option of dining at the informal osteria next door.
