Il Frantoio	via Fontebella	25	Assisi	06081	€€€	ModernCuisine	This restaurant has undergone a skilful refurbishment with a focus on colour, light and furnishings which combine harmoniously with the valley below, as well as with the dishes in which extra-virgin olive oil takes a starring role (not just as a condiment but as an ingredient in its own right). The view through the floor-to-ceiling windows, which extends along the valley as far as San Pietro abbey in Assisi, is as enticing as the cuisine.
