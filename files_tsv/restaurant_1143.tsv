3.0 Ciro Cascella	via San Pasquale 68	Naples	80121	Italy	€	Pizza	Fans of Neapolitan pizza will be in their element at this restaurant, where the pizzas are light, with a larger and softer crust, thanks to the long fermentation and leavening process – some people come here simply to eat the crust, it’s so good. There’s also a wide choice of excellent toppings, including top-quality ingredients from Campania. Gluten-free options and dough made from different flours are also available.
