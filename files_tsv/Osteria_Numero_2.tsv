Osteria Numero 2	via Ghisiolo 2/a	Stradella	46051	Italy	€	Italian,ClassicCuisine	A beautiful farmhouse not far from the town, with a friendly, welcoming and colourful feel. Here, the menu features Italian dishes alongside a few local specialities, such as agnoli pasta in broth (also available as an antipasto in a “sorbir” wine broth). Special mention goes to the superb selection of beers chosen by owner Moreno, which ranges from local craft beers to labels from across the globe – there’s even a beer-themed dessert, the Birramisù. Excellent value for money and highly popular, so booking ahead is recommended.
