Viva il Bistrot	via Rocco Pirri 19	Noto	96017	Italy	€€	Sicilian,ModernCuisine	Situated just a stone’s throw from the cathedral, this restaurant has tables set out on Noto’s attractive pedestrianised street in fine weather, although if these are all taken the contemporary-style dining rooms are just as appealing. Viviana Varese, a Michelin-starred chef from Milano, oversees the interesting menu which showcases Sicilian cuisine prepared from local ingredients alongside more exotic fare.
