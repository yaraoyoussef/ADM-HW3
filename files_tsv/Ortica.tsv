Ortica	via Giovanni Migone 4	Pieve Ligure	16031	Italy	€€	Farmtotable,RegionalCuisine	You drive along 4.5km of winding, narrow (occasionally extremely narrow) roads to get to Ortica, the restaurant at the Tenuta Golfo Paradiso about 35min from Genoa. As is often the case, once at your destination the extensive views of the Tyrrhenian Sea from the restaurant more than compensate for the effort of getting here. Neither will you be disappointed by the cuisine, which is prepared using top-quality ingredients such as vegetables from the restaurant’s own kitchen garden, local fish and carefully selected meat. Dishes are fresh and modern, and occasionally cooked over the barbecue grill.
