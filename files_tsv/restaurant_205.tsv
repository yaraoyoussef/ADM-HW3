Cucina	Via Giano della Bella 3r	Florence	50124	Italy	€€	Tuscan,HomeCooking	At this restaurant, local ingredients (mainly from the market) take pride of place on the daily menu which changes in accordance with whatever produce is available at the time. The rustic-style dishes are full of intense flavours, with meat and vegetables often cooked in the wood-fired oven. The pleasantly informal dining room with its many cookery books dotted here and there was designed by the owner-architects themselves.
