Don Alfonso 1890 San Barbato	SS 93	km 56	300	Lavello	€€€	Countrycooking,Creative	Run by the Iaccarino family, who are renowned for their Mediterranean cuisine at Sant'Agata sui Due Golfi (some dishes from which feature on the menu here), this restaurant owes much to its talented chef Donato De Leonardis. His excellent cuisine includes regional influences with a hint of exotic flavour in dishes that are balanced, harmonious and often original without becoming excessively extravagant. The restaurant occupies the first floor of the luxury San Barbato Resort, which has a strong and committed approach to sustainable resource management. The modern, spacious dining room overlooks the illuminated fountain in the hotel garden.
