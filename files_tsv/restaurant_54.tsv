Vesta Mare	viale Roma 41	Marina di Pietrasanta	55045	Italy	€€€	Seafood,ClassicCuisine	This typical, elegant Versilian beach club with an open-plan feel extending from the car park to the beach serves top-quality cuisine to guests. Its facilities include an entrance lounge, stylish dining room full of character, a swimming pool and a second lounge space. The menu is simpler at lunchtime, except during the low season when you can request the gourmet menu (normally only served in the evenings) when booking. Fish and seafood take pride of place on the menu, with classic dishes reinterpreted with a modern twist by a chef who takes particular care with presentation.
