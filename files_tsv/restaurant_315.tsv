Il Cascinalenuovo	SS 231  Asti-Alba 15	Isola d'Asti	14057	Italy	€€€	Piedmontese,ModernCuisine	Having been in business for over 50 years and with a newly expanded team, Il Cascinalenuovo continues to serve its classic favourites (such as veal’s tongue millefeuille and foie gras with port jelly, and Piedmontese tonnato) while also extending its repertoire to include new options, including fish. The Ferretto brothers are still at the helm here, one front of house, the other in the kitchen. If the weather allows, book a table in the attractive outdoor space overlooking the garden and swimming pool.
