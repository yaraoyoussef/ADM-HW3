Veranda	viale Giosuè Carducci 140	Cesenatico	47042	Italy	€€	Seafood	Alberto Faccani, the two-Michelin starred chef at the Magnolia restaurant in the hills inland from Cesenatico, oversees the cuisine at this restaurant. Fish takes centre stage here, in unfussy dishes that faithfully reflect the maritime traditions of the Adriatic. Primi courses include raw dishes, gratins, seafood salads, pasta and risotto, while secondi feature a selection of grilled, baked and fried fish (depending on the day’s catch).
