Head up the most famous flight of steps in the world to the Hassler hotel, where you take a lift up to one of the Italian capital’s most celebrated restaurants. Here, you dine surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows that offer superb views of Rome, from the twin bell towers of Trinità dei Monti church to a whole host of the city’s iconic monuments – see how many you can recognise! In the meantime, chef Andrea Antonini prepares two tasting menus that showcase his classic dishes alongside more recent creations. His cuisine is often based on recognised recipes and ingredients, while also exploring new ideas, unusual combinations and amusing reinterpretations.
