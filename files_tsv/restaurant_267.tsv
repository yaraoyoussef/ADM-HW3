Capriccio	piazza San Bernardo 6	località Montinelle	Manerba del Garda	25080	€€€	ModernCuisine,Seafood	This restaurant standing on the shores of Lake Garda has been famous ever since it opened in the mid-1960s, thanks to its female owner’s passion for fish and seafood from the Mediterranean. Today, Giuliana continues to showcase fresh fish in her classic-style recipes and demonstrates real skill in bringing out the full flavour of her ingredients on a menu which also includes a few meat specialities. Among her memorable historic dishes are the aubergine parmigiana (on the menu since 1965) and the red berry soup marinated in cooked wine must and served with ice-cream and Italian-style meringue. Daughter Francesca offers guests a friendly welcome front of house, assisting them with their choice of dishes and also providing wine pairing recommendations. The interesting wine list will delight lovers of champagne and German Riesling. In summer, take a seat in the large, comfortable outdoor dining space with the restaurant’s bucolic garden in front of you and the lake in the background.
