Il Molo	via Aganor Pompili 9	Passignano sul Trasimeno	6065	Italy	€€	Countrycooking,Contemporary	Situated in the historic centre of Passignano, where the village seems to jut out into the Lake Trasimeno (some tables in the main dining room boast views of the lake – make sure you book in advance), Il Molo has become a popular choice for guests keen to try top-quality fish from the lake as well as excellent poultry dishes. We highly recommend the delicious stuffed quail served with mushrooms and liver and accompanied by an excellent glass of local biodynamic red wine. There’s also a good choice of sparkling wines and champagnes.	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	['Amex', 'Maestrocard', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 075 827151	https://www.ristoranteilmolo.com/
