Sabir	via delle Ginestre 1	Zafferana Etnea	95019	Italy	€€€	Creative	Colourful Mediterranean cuisine with the occasional creative twist, yet always based on local specialities. This attractive restaurant takes its name from an old dialect once in use in the ports of the Mediterranean – a sort of Esperanto for sea merchants. In summer, ask for one of the tables in the cool and romantic garden.
