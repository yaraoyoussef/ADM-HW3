Duomo	via Parma 28	Alessandria	15121	Italy	€€	ItalianContemporary	This small restaurant with a bright and welcoming dining room stands out for its contemporary-style cuisine (based around seasonal ingredients) and many home-cooked dishes. The two brothers at the helm create interesting, often regionally inspired recipes with clever personalised twists. On the autumn menu, we particularly recommend the venison with cauliflower, almonds and Barbera wine sauce. Those with a sweet tooth will enjoy the panna cotta with a persimmon coulis (delicious but not too sweet!), while wine-enthusiasts will find plenty to interest them on the extensive wine list. The restaurant also boasts a superb location, nestled in the narrow streets of the centre just a stone’s throw from the Duomo.
