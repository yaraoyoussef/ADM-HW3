Il Visibilio	SP 9 di Pievasciata 32	Castelnuovo Berardenga	53019	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	You’ll come to the imposing gate of The Club House hotel at the end of a dirt track which leads from the contemporary art village of Pievasciata into the surrounding cultivated hills. Il Visibilio, the hotel’s small gourmet restaurant, is the setting for the happy partnership between Tuscan chef Daniele Canella and two-Michelin-starred chef Giuseppe Iannotti from Krèsios in Telese Terme. The latter brings to the Sienese countryside a similar formula to the one introduced in his own restaurant, namely a single blind tasting menu. This long gourmet feast features surprise meat and fish dishes as well as an abundant use of vegetables, showcasing technical flourishes that are especially evident in the finger-food appetisers, resulting in a top-quality fine-dining experience. Our inspector recommends the pigeon with its delicious rhubarb and absinthe sauce.	Air conditioning, Garden or park, Great view	Amex, Dinersclub, Mastercard, Visa	+39 0577 357503
