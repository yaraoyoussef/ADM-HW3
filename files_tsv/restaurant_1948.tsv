I Castagni	via Ottobiano 8/20	Vigevano	27029	Italy	€€€	ClassicCuisine,Countrycooking	Situated in the countryside outside Vigevano, this rustic country house with a portico has the feel of a private villa thanks to its antique furniture and paintings by local artists on the walls. For more than 30 years, Enrico Gerli, together with his wife, who is charge of the front of house, has run this restaurant with dedication and professionalism, creating classic-modern cuisine which showcases the culinary traditions of Lombardy alongside a few fish-based dishes. Our inspector particularly recommends the black plin ravioli filled with peas and served with a white cuttlefish and mussel sauce. A wine cellar home to around 600 labels from around the world adds to the appeal.
