L'Angolo d'Abruzzo	piazza Aldo Moro 8	Carsoli	67061	Italy	€€	CuisinefromAbruzzo,TraditionalCuisine	For almost 40 years, the Angolo d’Abruzzo restaurant has been home to the Centofanti family, who act as excellent ambassadors for the region by offering the best local, seasonal ingredients (for this reason, there’s no fish on the menu) in a host of traditional, regional recipes. Specialities such as cured meats, local ham, bruschetta and fresh home-made pasta (including “chitarra” spaghetti) take centre stage, while main courses include grilled dishes (porcini mushrooms in season, cuts of beef and veal at any time of year) and stews (mutton etc). When it comes to dessert, make sure you try the crème caramel with Navelli saffron. A misleading sign saying “sagrestia” (sacristy) actually indicates the well-stocked wine cellar.
