Wood	via Guido Rey 26	Breuil Cervinia	11021	Italy	€€€	Creative,Contemporary	As its name suggests, this restaurant is decorated with a profusion of wood, partly because of its mountain location but also because the excellent female chef is originally from Lapland in northern Sweden. Her cuisine is a surprising and successful combination of Scandinavian traditions, Italian flavours and more exotic Asian influences. The result is excellent, original cuisine served at an altitude of 2 000m in the centre of Breuil-Cervinia, accompanied by a wine list featuring top-quality labels (including some rare vintages) with a focus on Piedmont.
