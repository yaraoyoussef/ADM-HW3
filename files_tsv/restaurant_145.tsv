Together they create exciting, modern Mediterranean cuisine using ingredients from their native regions, including their signature dish – homemade spaghetti served with a delicious, well-balanced 'nduja, smoked ricotta and tomato ristretto sauce. Top-quality local ingredients take pride of place, as demonstrated by the Brogna mutton, which is raised on site, barbecued and served with an exquisite caper sauce and seasonal mushroom pie. The concise wine list features labels from the Veneto alongside a few French options.
