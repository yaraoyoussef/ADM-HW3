Parizzi	strada della Repubblica 71	Parma	43121	Italy	€€€	Creative	Based around carefully chosen ingredients sourced from the best local producers, the cuisine served at this restaurant is light and yet tasty. You’ll find typical Parma dishes on the menu here alongside more creative fare, with a slight emphasis on fish and seafood although meat and game (one of the chef’s passions!) also make an appearance. Together with his wife Cristina who oversees the front of house, chef Marco Parizzi continues his family’s tradition of providing a warm welcome and excellent cuisine. Guestrooms (this is a convenient central location) are also available.
