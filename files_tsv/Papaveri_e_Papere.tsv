Papaveri e Papere	via Dalmazia 159/d	San Miniato	56028	Italy	€€	Tuscan,ModernCuisine	The cuisine at this restaurant focuses on local recipes and ingredients yet also has a light, modern flavour and beautiful contemporary presentation, as seen in the pici pasta with roast peppers, sweetbreads and pecorino cheese. The chef here is equally at ease with meat and fish, and particularly keen on vegetables, with white truffles from San Miniato featuring on the menu in the autumn.
