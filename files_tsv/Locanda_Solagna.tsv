Renowned for its excellent regional cuisine served in the evening, the restaurant pays careful attention to seasonal ingredients. At lunchtime, the ”osteria”-style menu is much simpler. Excellent wine selection.	['Air conditioning', 'Garden or park', 'Interesting wine list', 'Terrace']	['Amex', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0439 788019	https://www.locandasolagna.it/
