Andrea Monesi - Locanda di Orta	via Olina 18	Orta San Giulio	28016	Italy	€€€€	Countrycooking,Creative	Situated in the historic centre of one of the most romantic lakeside villages in Italy, and offering a picture-postcard view of bygone days, this small building houses a contemporary-style restaurant (including a recently opened private dining room) with just one table for two on its romantic outdoor terrace. The cuisine here is creative and precise, with a menu that features fish and seafood alongside top-quality meat from the Piedmont. Each recipe is personalised, often focusing on contrasting flavours and textures, while the wine list is overseen by an excellent sommelier who is happy to guide you in your choice. The imaginative desserts are also well worth a mention.	['Air conditioning', 'Interesting wine list']	['Amex', 'Dinersclub', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0322 905188	https://www.andreamonesi.com/
