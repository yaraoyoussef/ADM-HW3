Nobuya	Via San Nicolao 3/a	Milan	20123	Italy	€€€	JapaneseContemporary,ModernCuisine	Nobuya boasts a minimalist elegance that is typical of Japanese restaurants, with brown tables, dark wooden beams on the ceiling, attractive subdued lighting, plus an illuminated wine cabinet to add a touch of colour. Here, the talented Japanese chef creates top-quality cuisine using the freshest ingredients. At lunchtime, there’s also a lighter “Bento box” and an omakase tasting menu (“Mi affido a te”) which is completely vegetarian.
