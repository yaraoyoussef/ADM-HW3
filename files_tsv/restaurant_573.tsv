La Pineta	via dei Cavalleggeri Nord 27	Marina di Bibbona	57020	Italy	€€€	Seafood,ClassicCuisine	By car you drive through a pine wood and practically reach the water's edge, facing a horizon of beach, sea and waves, to the left you’ll notice a small low house that almost looks like an ordinary beach establishment: actually, it is the historical fish restaurant of the Zazzeri family, Daniele in the kitchen and Andrea in the dining room. Always true to themselves, without any need to look for sudden modern changes of direction, the simplicity of the cuisine, which matches the vintage style of the rooms, is their absolute direction, both in the pairings and in the ultra-classic cooking techniques; as long as the quality of the fish (mostly local) and the comforting quality of the end result remain unchanged, it will always be a pleasure to recommend this place above the fashions.
