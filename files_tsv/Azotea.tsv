Azotea	via Maria Vittoria 49/b	Turin	10123	Italy	€€	Peruvian,Japanese	Situated in a central location with a small outdoor space, this restaurant boasts a striking interior with old walls, a verdant decor and climbing plants that add a South American feel. The cuisine shines the spotlight on the chef’s native Peru, with appetisers such as potted umbrine tacos and delicious yet atypical antipasti such as raw squid with saltwort and peas. Soy sauce, umeboshi, and yuyo seaweed sauce provide added exotic flavour. We highly recommend one of the excellent cocktails, such as the slightly sour Americano with yuzu.
