Ménage	Via Euplio Reina 13	Catania	95121	Italy	€€	Sicilian,Contemporary	Situated in the heart of the city near the Teatro Bellini and Piazza Università, this restaurant occupies an Art Nouveau-style building. Here, a trio of experienced young chefs from Catania have brought new life to the old “Da Turi Finocchiaro” restaurant, which has always been very popular with the city’s high society. Offering a small outdoor space near the entrance, the quiet, intimate dining room on the ground floor provides the backdrop for reinterpreted, contemporary Sicilian cuisine with an exclusive focus on meat (especially barbecued dishes which are the restaurant’s trademark), while the first floor is home to a cocktail bar run with passion by one of the partners. Two frescoes painted by Giuseppe Barone in 1930 add to the appeal.	Air conditioning, Terrace, Wheelchair access	Amex, Dinersclub, Mastercard, Visa	+39 095 0927 2933	https://www.menagelounge.it/
