21.9	Località Carretta 4	Piobesi d'Alba	12040	Italy	€€€	Countrycooking,Creative	Run by chef Flavio Costa, Ligurian by birth and Piedmontese by adoption, this restaurant is named after the date his twin daughters were born. Housed on an estate that was producing wine as early as the 15C, the restaurant boasts stunning views of the surrounding hills and vineyards. Here, Flavio creates imaginative cuisine that harmoniously combines ingredients from Piedmont (meat) and Liguria (fish), as well as more contemporary combinations. We particularly enjoyed the pigeon, turnip greens and sweetcorn, as well as the chocolate, sweet beetroot and coconut dessert. In season, there’s also a menu featuring game dishes.
