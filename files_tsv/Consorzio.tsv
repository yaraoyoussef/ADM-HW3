Consorzio	via Monte di Pietà 23	Turin	10122	Italy	€€	Piedmontese,TraditionalCuisine	Despite its simple, no-frills atmosphere, Consorzio serves some of the most interesting and acclaimed Piedmontese cuisine in the city. Specialities include ravioli with either Tumin del Mel cheese or “finanziera”, and traditional meat-filled agnolotti pasta. Meat also makes a strong appearance on the list of main courses, including in less “noble” but equally memorable dishes featuring offal and tripe.
