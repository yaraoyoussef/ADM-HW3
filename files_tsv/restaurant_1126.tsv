Ca' d'Frara	via del Gambero 4	Ferrara	44121	Italy	€€	Emilian	Tucked away in a corner of the town centre, this restaurant has a small entrance that opens into two bright and airy dining rooms with an elegant feel. The cuisine is typical of Romagna with a focus on home-made pastas and delicious main courses such as tripe alla parmigiana. If you’re not sure what to choose, we suggest opting for the traditional tasting menu which is impressive, both in terms of quality and value for money. Professional yet unfussy service.
