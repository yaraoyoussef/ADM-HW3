ARIA	via Loggia dei Pisani 2	Naples	80133	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary,ModernCuisine	The ambience at this hushed and discreet restaurant couldn’t be more different from the hustle and bustle of the elegant district in which it is situated. The softly lit dining rooms are elegant and minimalist in style, with lamps creating pools of light illuminating the dishes conjured up by Paolo Barrale. Originally from Cefalù but now settled in Campania, the chef’s cuisine is inspired by the culinary traditions of both regions which he reinterprets with ease, occasionally creating more personalised dishes. Generous in every way, from the warm welcome to the cuisine right up to dessert, Paolo offers guests a top-quality dining experience ably assisted by his well-trained, professional staff.
