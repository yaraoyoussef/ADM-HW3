Al Petes	Via dei Capitelli 5/a	Trieste	34121	Italy	€€€	Seafood,International	Situated amid the alleyways of the historic centre, Al Petes has a pleasant contemporary feel and is run by young, welcoming and friendly owners. Marko’s menu demonstrates an obvious preference for seafood, most of which comes from the Adriatic, and which is served with Mediterranean and even occasional Asian influences. The surprise tasting menu is highly recommended. Just around the corner, the restaurant’s small hotel (James Joyce) is the ideal choice for overnight accommodation.
