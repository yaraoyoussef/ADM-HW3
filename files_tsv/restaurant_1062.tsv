Trattoria della Fortuna	Via Salaria 57	Monterotondo	00015	Italy	€€	RegionalCuisine,SeasonalCuisine	This interior of this trattoria occupying an anonymous rural building at a road junction just outside the village comes as something of a surprise. Inside, the dining room has a warm ambience, with a friendly welcome offered by the female staff. The dishes here are authentic and full of flavour, with a focus on regional Italian traditions and top-quality local ingredients – all the pasta and desserts are homemade. We particularly recommend two of the specialities, namely the “Girella e Cartellata” (made using 36 egg yolks) stuffed with ricotta and goat’s cheese and served with a “ciauscolo” (a type of sausage typical of the Marche and Umbria) ragu and a red wine reduction. A small, simple pergola-shaded outdoor space completes the picture.	Air conditioning, Terrace, Wheelchair access	Amex, Dinersclub, Mastercard, Visa	+39 06 900 4098
