Lofficina	via Piave 11	Sirolo	60020	Italy	€€	Creative,Contemporary	This building with a minimalist, contemporary design is situated on the edge of the historic centre at the Sant'Erasmo belvedere from where, in summer, panoramic views extend over Monte Conero and the sea (booking ahead is recommended). In the kitchen, owner-chef Davide Breccia conjures up creative dishes featuring original combinations and mainly inspired by the sea. Our inspector’s favourite dish was the marinated amberjack with passion fruit, black pepper and vanilla. The freshness of the fish is enhanced by the chef’s balanced and individual approach.
