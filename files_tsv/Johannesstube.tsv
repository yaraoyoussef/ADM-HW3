Johannesstube	via San Valentino 3	Nova Levante	39056	Italy	€€€€	Alpine,ModernCuisine	The strictly regional ingredients used at this restaurant are sourced from local farmers and producers, with just a few exceptions such as sugar, truffles, salt, rice etc. Chef Theodor Falser is a purist where the region’s plentiful produce is concerned, although he does admit to a weakness for cooking and fermentation methods from further afield. He considers himself fortunate to have been born in these mountains and this good fortune is shared by those who are lucky enough to dine in this historic Stube-style restaurant built using vintage wood, which is the jewel in the Engel hotel’s crown. There’s also an excellent wine list with a focus on the Alto Adige.
