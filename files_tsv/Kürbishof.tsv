Kürbishof	via Guggal 23	Anterivo	39040	Italy	€€	RegionalCuisine,ModernCuisine	This romantic inn with guestrooms occupies an old farm with a hay barn. In two typical Stube-style rooms, one of which offers views of the Cembra valley, enjoy cuisine prepared by a mother-and-son team. They work side by side, preparing dishes from mainly regional ingredients (the menu often includes the names of producers) each in their own individual way, which is highlighted on the menu: to the left, you’ll find the traditional dishes made by the mother, Sara, while on the right you can choose from a selection of modern, creative options prepared by young chef Mathias. Our inspectors were delighted with their combination of choices from both lists!	['Car park']	['Amex', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0471 882140	https://www.kuerbishof.it
