La Pergola	via Cadlolo 101	Rome	00136	Italy	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine,Contemporary	Following complete refurbishment, the new Pergola pays tribute to the colours and materials of Rome, from the Travertine marble to the red colour scheme. The terrace has also had a face-lift, but fortunately the view hasn’t changed – however many times you come here, you find that your memory never quite does justice to the magnificent and expansive views of the capital. Below Monte Mario hill, the whole of Rome, encircled by hills, is spread out before you, appearing silent and enchanted, almost as if it were dozing. Although he’s been at the helm here since 1994, Heinz Beck’s enthusiasm remains undiminished, as he continues to update his dishes, explore new avenues and create imaginative cuisine with a strong Italian and Mediterranean flavour. In addition to the spectacular wine list, there’s also a remarkable choice of water and coffee.
