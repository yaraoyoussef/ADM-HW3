Il Cortiletto	via F.lli Bianchi 1	Toscolano-Maderno	25088	Italy	€€	Countrycooking,MediterraneanCuisine	Standing on the Lake Garda road, this small, simple, yet far from ordinary restaurant serves Mediterranean dishes with the occasional inventive twist. Two words of advice – opt for alfresco dining in fine weather, and don’t miss the maccheroncini served with perch and lemon pesto sauce.
