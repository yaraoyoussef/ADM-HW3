Volta del Fuenti by Michele De Blasio	SS 163 Amalfitana km 47	300	Vietri sul Mare	84019	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Once you’ve passed through Vietri heading towards the Amalfi Coast, you come to the Giardini del Fuenti perched on a cliff sloping towards the sea. This hotel complex boasts a beach, terraced garden and the Riva Restaurant, which is open at lunchtime only and which also hosts various food and wine events. In a spacious dining room with large windows overlooking the beautiful bay, chef Michele De Blasio serves modern, elaborate and minimalist-style dishes based on reinterpretations of classic specialities from Campania, all showcased on two tasting menus and an à la carte. We particularly enjoyed the excellent and copious welcome snacks, with a special mention for the local speciality, Vietrese donkey meat, and the veal sweetbreads with citrus fruit, walnuts and rocket.
