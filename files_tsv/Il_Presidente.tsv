Il Presidente	via de Nicastri 10	Lucera	71036	Italy	€€€	Seafood,MediterraneanCuisine	This restaurant situated in an alleyway in the historic centre just a few metres from Lucera’s cathedral was once home to the stables of an old palazzo. Nowadays, the dining room, which is crowned by a stone-vaulted ceiling and decorated in shades of black and gold, is divided into small sections. In the middle room, two glass cabinets display the wine selection, which includes over 400 different labels. The Mediterranean cuisine served here is modern and colourful, with vegetables often accompanying the fish and seafood (red tuna, swordfish, prawns, scampi and a delicious seafood focaccia). The ingredients are more important than the technique, resulting in dishes that are full of flavour!
