Giglio	piazza del Giglio 2	Lucca	55100	Italy	€€€	ClassicCuisine,Italian	Housed in a beautiful 18C palazzo, Giglio was founded in 1979 and is now run by three young men who took over just a few years ago. These three friends form a real team, who have come together to inject new life into the restaurant which stands on one of the many squares in Lucca’s charming historic centre. In fine weather, guests can enjoy the lively summer atmosphere outdoors, while those who prefer a quieter ambience can book a table in the more austere and elegant dining room indoors. Modern cuisine with a very Italian feel, combined with French techniques and the occasional use of international ingredients.
