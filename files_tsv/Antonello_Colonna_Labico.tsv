Antonello Colonna Labico	via di Valle Fredda 52	Labico	00030	Italy	€€€€	ItalianContemporary	Situated in a scenically impressive setting nestling in the Vallefredda countryside and housed in an original, avant-garde building, this sophisticated restaurant serves carefully balanced and elegant dishes that underline its proximity to Rome and its close connection with Lazio’s rural traditions. Here, nature and modernity go hand in hand: the restaurant is home to large, almost museum-like rooms adorned with works of art and surrounded by parkland. The dishes, on the other hand, are classic in style, in deliberate contrast to the striking, contemporary backdrop in which they are served, and are inspired by many of Italy’s different culinary traditions. We highly recommended booking a table on the lawn under the mature chestnut trees in summer.
