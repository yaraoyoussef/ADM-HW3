Felix Lo Basso home & restaurant	via Carlo Goldoni 36	Milan	20129	Italy	€€€€	ItalianContemporary,Creative	Brilliant chef Felix Lo Basso’s menu is inspired by northern Europe: he offers one single menu that changes regularly depending on market availability and that requires all diners to book ahead and eat at the same time. Although the dishes are inventive and occasionally elaborate, the chef often creates unique reinterpretations of recipes and ingredients from his native Puglia, occasionally with an original Asian twist. Beyond the small rooms used for private dinners, the main dining room features an elegant counter along which guests can sit and watch the chefs at work, with Felice cooking and entertaining his diners with his full range of personal skills to put guests at ease. We’re going to keep the dessert a secret but will give you just one word as a clue – Nuvola (the Italian for cloud).
