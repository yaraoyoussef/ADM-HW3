Duanima	via Sebastiano Satta 28	Cagliari	09128	Italy	€€	Contemporary	This is one of Cagliari’s most interesting restaurants – a real must if you find yourself visiting Sardinia’s capital city. In its long, narrow dining room with modern furnishings, enjoy simple, unfussy cuisine that is full of intense flavours. Most of the dishes are influenced by the chef’s experience working abroad, while also demonstrating his re-connection with his native island, with a focus on Sardinia’s top-quality ingredients.
