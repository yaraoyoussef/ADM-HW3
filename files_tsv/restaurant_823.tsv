A' Cuncuma	via Judica 21/23	Palermo	90134	Italy	€€€	Creative,Sicilian	In 2022, young sous-chef Gianfilippo Gatto became the owner-chef of this simple and intimate restaurant situated in Palermo’s historic centre. The key attraction here is the quality of the cuisine, which features colourful dishes and modern interpretations of Sicilian recipes (meat and fish alike). Examples include arancina stuffed with young caciocavallo cheese and cooked in the oven, then topped with orange prawn tartare and served on a prawn bisque. The excellent wine list is completely Sicilian, with separate sections dedicated to the Etna wines produced in different parts of the region, many of which are young, promising and highly recommended!
