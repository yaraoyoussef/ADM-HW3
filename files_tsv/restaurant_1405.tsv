Antica Osteria Cera	via Marghera 24	Lughetto	30010	Italy	€€€€	Seafood,ModernCuisine	One of Italy’s most famous addresses for fish and seafood, this restaurant offers an extensive menu featuring classic house favourites alongside a growing list of more modern options. In this elegant, modern and minimalist-style setting (despite the name, don’t expect a trattoria-style ambience here!) enjoy raw fish dishes and grilled options alongside more traditional, often Venetian, specialities such as the Venetian-style spider crab, and classic Italian dishes such as the warm steamed fish salad and the fritto misto (mixed fried fish). In all dishes, the excellent quality of the ingredients shines through. There’s also an excellent wine list, with a particular focus on white wines.
