Ai Torchi	via dell'Annunziata 12	Finalborgo	17024	Italy	€€€	Seafood,Ligurian	Occupying a 17C olive oil press in the heart of a charming medieval village, this restaurant has retained its old stone mill and wooden press in its vaulted dining room, which provides the backdrop for imaginative fish and seafood dishes prepared using top-quality local ingredients. The delicious Italian-style ceviche is made from the catch of the day, while the Mare Mare mixed fish dish is baked in a casserole with cherry tomatoes, courgettes and bay leaves. If you’re looking for a simpler option, try the I Torchiettibistro on the corner of the same street.	[]	['Amex', 'Dinersclub', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 019 690531	https://aitorchi.it/ai-torchi/
