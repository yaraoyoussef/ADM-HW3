Il Ciabot	via Costa 7	Roletto	10060	Italy	â‚¬	Piedmontese,ModernCuisine	Warmed by an open fire in winter, this welcoming family-run restaurant celebrates the cuisine of Piedmont, although a few fish dishes also feature on the menu. Traditional, time-honoured and overlooked dishes take pride of place, such as boiled meat terrine with a salsa verde, Fassone beef in a crust, plus an excellent giandujotto chocolate mousse. Booking ahead is recommended.	['Terrace']	['Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0121 542132	https://www.ristoranteilciabot.it/
