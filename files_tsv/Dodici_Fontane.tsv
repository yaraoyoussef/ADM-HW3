Dodici Fontane	contrada Arrigo	Linguaglossa	95015	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine,Creative	The scenery that you drive through to get to this restaurant on the slopes of Mt Etna is as breathtaking and impressive as the charming luxury Villa Neri hotel in which it is housed. In the modern dining room, the chef serves cuisine with a focus on Sicilian recipes and ingredients to which he adds a personalised and creative twist, resulting in occasionally complex dishes which are always of the highest quality. The wine list includes an excellent and highly recommended selection of local Etna labels.
