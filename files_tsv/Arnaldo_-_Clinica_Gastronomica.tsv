Arnaldo - Clinica Gastronomica	piazza XXIV Maggio 3	Rubiera	42048	Italy	€€€	Emilian	This restaurant was first awarded a Michelin star in 1959, which makes it the longest-held star (with a break of only two years) in Italy. Housed in a 15C palazzo next to the Aquila d'Oro hotel, the dining room boasts an atmospheric and nostalgic feel. The cuisine has the same traditional focus and celebrates Emilian traditions in all their glory, especially on the trolleys used to display selections of antipasti (sliced ham always features, as does spinach and cheese pie), and desserts (including a delicious zabaione served with pear in red wine and a creamy Sambuca semifreddo. But the undisputed stars of the show are the meat dishes, especially the two trolleys of specialities that are the highlight of any visit to Arnaldo. These include roast and boiled meats, including dishes not often found in a restaurant of this quality, such as calf’s head, tongue and pig’s trotters, all cooked traditionally and served with the usual sauces and gravies. Every morning, the “sfogline” pasta-makers prepare excellent fresh pastas, which are served either in a broth or simply with sage and butter. Arnaldo is not a place for fans of modern cuisine but if you’re keen to try authentic Emilian dishes full of flavour, you’ll be in your element here!
