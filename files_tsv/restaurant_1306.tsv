[bu:r]	via Giuseppe Mercalli 22	Milan	20122	Italy	€€€€	Creative,International	Eugenio Boer offers a 100% Italian menu which focuses on local ingredients, with the aim of showcasing some of Italy’s favourite traditional dishes while at the same time supporting small-scale producers. However, this philosophy is in no way limited to respecting traditions – on the contrary, it offers the chef the freedom to express his own creativity via a selection of dishes which combine past and present. As a result, guests can choose between a concise à la carte and three different tasting menus: “I Classici” (meat-based dishes); “Lo Stagionale” (fish and seasonal ingredients); and “Per mano...”, a menu which changes depending on the chef’s creative inspiration. In short, a flexible approach which offers guests a culinary experience that will certainly make an impression!
