Il Circolino	via Anita Garibaldi 4	Monza	20900	Italy	€€€	Creative,Contemporary	At Il Circolino, enjoy interesting cuisine designed by Claudio Sadler and prepared by skilful resident chef Lorenzo Sacchi. There’s a café-cum-bistro at the entrance, with its own kitchen and an attractive garden for summer dining, while the elegant, contemporary-style restaurant is hidden behind a folding door. The gourmet meat and fish dishes served here are showcased on various menus from which guests can also choose courses à la carte style. On the “C’era una volta” menu, we particularly enjoyed the spaghetti with missoltino fish and carp butter, which is decorated with colourful flowers and has decisive flavours, while the mullet served with a Spanish-style “suquet” made from carefully chosen ingredients stood out on the “Viaje” menu. Among the desserts, the black lemon, shiso and kombu seaweed has a fresh and exotic flavour. If you enjoy watching the chefs at work, make sure you book the table in front of the kitchen.
