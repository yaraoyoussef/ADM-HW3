Rendenèr Alpine Food	Via Sorano 35	Pinzolo	38086	Italy	€€	Contemporary	Situated within the Lory hotel, this restaurant has a contemporary decor and wooden tables that give it an informal ambience. Here, the young talented chef creates Alpine cuisine from carefully chosen seasonal ingredients, with menus changing throughout the year. In spring, for example, ingredients include Alpine sow-thistle, Mugo pine shoots, woodruff and lichen, while in summer herbs and flowers from the restaurant’s own organic kitchen garden add extra flavour to dishes. An interesting wine list with a focus on regional labels completes the picture.	Car park	Amex, Jcb, Maestrocard, Mastercard, Visa	+39 0465 502008	https://rendeneralpinefood.it/
