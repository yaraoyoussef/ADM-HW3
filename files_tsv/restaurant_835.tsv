MoS	via Porto Vecchio 28	Desenzano del Garda	25015	Italy	€€	Contemporary,SeasonalCuisine	The young Stefano Zanini, with plenty of experience in Italy and further afield, has injected new life into this old trattoria situated right in front of the marina in the historic heart of Desenzano. The personalised cuisine focuses on seasonal ingredients, including meat and fish from the lake and sea; one of the restaurant’s key tenets is recycling waste as much as possible. In summer, dine at one of the outdoor tables with views of the boats in the marina.	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	['Amex', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 030 914 3339	https://www.ristorantemos.it/
