Corte Sconta	calle del Pestrin	sestiere Castello 3886	Venice	30122	€€€	Seafood,Venetian	From its flooring to its tables, this restaurant has the charming, nostalgic feel of a typical trattoria in its simple dining room, while the outdoor space in an inner courtyard under a vine-shaded arbour is a charming place to eat in fine weather – a real gem right in the centre of Venice. The cuisine is as simple in style as the decor, with traditional Venetian fish and seafood dishes taking pride of place on the menu.
