Magnolia	via Pelliciano 35	loc. Montilgallo	Longiano	47020	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Situated in the elegant Relais Villa Margherita, an 18C villa converted into a stylish residence with just six guestrooms, verdant grounds and a swimming pool, Magnolia occupies a contemporary, veranda-style dining room with large picture windows boasting sweeping views of the Romagna hills as far as the mountainous “peak” of San Marino. Here, skilful chef Alberto Faccani serves a clever combination of the classic favourites that have marked his career, alongside other more unusual dishes that demonstrate a tireless search for experimentation. His contemporary style is elegant and balanced, as demonstrated by the delicate coconut milk sauce that provides the final flourish to his cuttlefish with caviar and peas.
