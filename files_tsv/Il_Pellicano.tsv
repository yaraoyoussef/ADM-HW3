Il Pellicano	località Lo Sbarcatello	Porto Ercole	58018	Italy	€€€€	Creative	After a period working in Paris, Michelino Gioia, a native of Campania with a weakness for Tuscany, has returned to Italy to work with the Sciò family, where he demonstrates a new focus on a “less is more” philosophy. He uses just a few ingredients in his dishes, allowing the flavour of these ingredients to shine through in imaginative reinterpretations of traditional recipes with contrasting textures, decisive flavours and an equal focus on meat and fish. With its terrace overlooking the sea and the scent of rosemary in the air, Il Pellicano is one of the most romantic addresses in Italy, enhanced by the friendly, professional service provided by its many staff.
