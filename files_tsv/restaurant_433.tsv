Le Trabe	via Capo di Fiume 4	Paestum	84047	Italy	€€€€	Campanian,Contemporary	This restaurant lies within the Capodifiume estate, a microcosm that is home to the source of the Trabe river (hence the restaurant name) and a hydroelectric power station which supplies the estate with its energy and which guests can visit with the friendly restaurant staff on a short but interesting tour before dinner. A welcome aperitif and canapés are served in the wine cellar, after which guests move to the elegant dining room – a beautiful setting which also takes into account respect for the environment, with various sustainable practices adopted by the restaurant. However, more than anything it is Marci Rispo’s cuisine that is truly memorable, showcased on two tasting menus that are inspired by the culinary traditions of Campania and its seasonal ingredients, such as the famous mozzarella used in the iconic “Bufala, bufala, bufala” dish. You’ll also be impressed by the attentive service offered by sommelier and maître-d’ Simone Munzillo and his team. In short, an enjoyable dining experience that offers an array of elegant and carefully curated dishes that are full of flavour.
