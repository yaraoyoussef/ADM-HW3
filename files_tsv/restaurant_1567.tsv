Caracol	via Faro 44	località Capo Miseno	Bacoli	80070	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine,Creative	The coast of Campania, and in particular the Bay of Naples, boasts a wealth of breathtaking views – and this is one of the most spectacular. Once you arrive at the Cala Moresca hotel, leave your car in the car park and hotel staff will accompany you to the restaurant. On a tranquil promontory surrounded by greenery, take a seat on a terrace overlooking the sea, with views of the islands of Procida and Ischia in front of you, the unmistakeable silhouette of Capri to your left and the mainland and mountains of Procida to your right – simply magnificent! At the helm in the kitchen, Angelo Carannante is the chef with the daunting task of competing with all this beauty, which he does with real aplomb. His long tasting menu features surprise courses in which he reinterprets regional traditions with freedom, creativity and the occasional exotic touch with outstanding results.
