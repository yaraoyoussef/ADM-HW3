Antica Corte Pallavicina	strada del Palazzo Due Torri 3	Polesine Parmense	43016	Italy	€€€€	Countrycooking,ModernCuisine	Situated in a fairytale setting, this property resembles a castle although it was in fact built as a customs house on the Po river in the 14C. Although the family’s ancestors were once workers on the nearby farm, Massimo Spigaroli now owns everything here (guestrooms, Hosteria del Maiale bistro, spaces for events and business meetings), offering an all-round experience that includes a visit to the unmissable Museo del Culatello as well as his “gastrofluvial” cuisine which has its roots in local traditions. We particularly enjoyed the chicken ravioli cooked in a bladder (a French technique), as well as the Nero Spigaroli suckling pig served with its crispy rind, prawns and green shoots.
