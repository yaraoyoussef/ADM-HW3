Magorabin	corso San Maurizio 61/d	Turin	10124	Italy	€€€	Contemporary,Creative	Situated near the Mole building, this restaurant has a modern, minimalist-style dining room with soft lighting, where food takes centre stage. Marcello Trentini is one of the most skilled and versatile chefs not only in Turin but also further afield. On tasting menus dedicated to his classic dishes, as well as a vegetarian menu (with the option of choosing courses à la carte style), this chef demonstrates his masterly, almost magical, skill in carefully designed complex cuisine inspired by Piedmontese and international (including Asian) recipes and flavours. Simple names and just a few words often conceal real masterpieces, with ingredients sometimes prepared in many different ways. Our inspector recommends the spaghettone with butter, anchovies and eel, served with caviar for enhanced flavour, and perhaps accompanied by a fresh and lightly fermented Falanghina Cacciagalli wine.
