Dalla Rosa Alda	strada Garibaldi 4	San Giorgio di Valpolicella	37015	Italy	€	Venetian,TraditionalCuisine	The undoubted star of this restaurant is the Enbogonè tagliatelle – a pasta made entirely by hand and seasoned with a sauce made from borlotti beans, local extra - virgin olive oil and rosemary – although the menu features many other dishes. Simple, honest cuisine made mainly from carefully selected regional produce, accompanied by an excellent selection of local wines.
