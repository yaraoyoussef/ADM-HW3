Vespasia	via Cesare Battisti 10	Norcia	06046	Italy	€€€€	Umbrian,Creative	Situated in the historic centre of Noto which is slowly returning to life after the earthquake, this restaurant is part of the smart Palazzo Seneca hotel. You pass through a succession of small rooms to get to the elegant Sala del Vespasia, where a female Japanese chef now showcases the best of Umbrian gastronomic delights after many years working in Campania and renowned restaurants elsewhere in Italy. Olive oil, cured hams, lentils, Cannara onions, crayfish and river fish, lamb from the Sibillini mountains and, of course, the excellent local black truffle are used in her creative and occasional complex dishes. Our description would not be complete without mentioning the excellent service and warm, friendly welcome offered by the Bianconi, a long-established family in Norcia’s hotel and restaurant sector.
