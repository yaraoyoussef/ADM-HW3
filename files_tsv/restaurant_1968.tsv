Locanda Margon	via Margone 15	Ravina	38123	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	This restaurant with views of Trento and the Adige valley is home to chef Edoardo Fumagalli, who puts all his energy and creativity into three tasting menus (one of which has been designed to combine perfectly with the Ferrari sparkling wine made by the winery that owns the restaurant). His menus showcase local ingredients (especially the Straordinario Trentinomenu), which he prepares with technical expertise, occasionally combining them with produce from further afield. Our inspector especially recommends the “Arlecchino” mountain egg with Trentingrana cream, bisque reduction with Chardonnay vinegar and puffed amaranth. Although the adjacent Bistrot is designed to be more informal in character, it offers the attraction of reliable Italian cuisine and the option of alfresco dining.
