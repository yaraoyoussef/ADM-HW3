Osmosi	via Umbria 65	Montepulciano	53045	Italy	€€€	Contemporary,Creative	Osmosi is part of the Fattoria Svetoni, a hotel with beautiful guestrooms housed in a historic villa overlooking vineyards in open countryside, and which also boasts a winery dating back to 1865. The restaurant is situated inside the old building, as well as on a modern veranda with views over the surrounding countryside through its floor-to-ceiling windows. Although Mirko Marcelli’s cuisine features some local specialities, it also includes more creative fare, hence the appearance of the famous local Chianina beef alongside an innovative gentian root rice dish. Other meat options include delicious breaded sweetbreads with peas, teriyaki and goat’s cheese, and duck with chard, confit leek and Cajun spices (a typical North-American spice mix). Guests have real freedom of choice with three tasting menus from which courses can also be chosen à la carte style. Enthusiastic owner Simone, ably assisted front of house by the friendly Elena, is on hand to help with recommendations from the detailed wine list.
