Vecchio Ristoro	via Tourneuve 4	Aosta	11100	Italy	€€€€	CuisinefromtheAostaValley,International	Despite its town-centre location and elegant ambience, this former 17C mill, which has retained its old wheel and millstone in the dining room, almost has the feel of the mountains. Here, the talented chef moves effortlessly between typical Aosta valley specialities, French dishes and international cuisine. The wine list offers well over 200 different labels, including carefully selected unusual wines alongside better-known options from leading producers. Excellent service.
