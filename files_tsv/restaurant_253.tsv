Il Sanlorenzo	via dei Chiavari 4/5	Rome	186	Italy	€€€€	Seafood,MediterraneanCuisine	A historic palazzo built over the foundations of the Teatro Pompeo is home to this atmospheric restaurant, which brings together history and contemporary art. However, the real star is the fish on the menu, most of which comes from the island of Ponza, and is served either raw or cooked very simply in a modern style.
