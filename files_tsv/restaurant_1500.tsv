Trattoria la Colonna	Via Emilia Est 6	località San Nicolò	Rottofreno	29010	€€	Seafood	This classic-style restaurant with a recently renovated dining room is situated on the street that runs through the village of San Nicolò. Although the menu features some meat dishes (on Sundays in winter, this includes specialities such as boiled meats, anolini pasta in broth, and typical desserts such as ciambella cake with zabaglione), it is particularly renowned for its wide selection of fish options. At lunchtime during the week, there’s a choice of simpler recipes, but if you ask, staff will be happy to offer you the longer evening menu.
