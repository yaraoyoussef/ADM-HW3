Saporium Firenze	lungarno Benvenuto Cellini 63r	Florence	50125	Italy	€€€€	Creative	A delightful small restaurant situated in a building on the Lungarno, close to the beautiful ascent on foot up to Piazzale Michelangelo. Vaulted ceilings and brick walls help to give the dining room a traditional atmosphere, which is enhanced by plants and elegant furniture. Young, talented chef Ariel Hagen delights guests with his highly personalised cuisine, using seasonal produce (such as fresh tagliolini pasta with elderflower) and fermented ingredients from his own workshop. The wine list is of the same high quality as the cuisine, featuring some excellent labels alongside an impressive choice of wines by the glass. In the evening, the Saporium Lounge serves tapas, wine and a selection of cocktails.
