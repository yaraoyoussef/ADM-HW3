Montagna in Valtellina	Sondrio	23020	€€	CuisinefromValtellina,Lombardian	This long-established restaurant just outside Sondrio has been run for the past decade by Gianluca, whose experience injects new life into traditional dishes from the local region, as well as introducing the occasional Mediterranean twist. There’s a simpler menu at lunchtime, plus a good selection of local wines and cheeses on sale at takeaway prices near the restaurant entrance.
