Antica Osteria del Ponte	piazza Gaetano Negri 9	Cassinetta di Lugagnano	20081	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary	This renowned restaurant in Lombardy has made its mark on the history of Italian cuisine and now has a new young couple at the helm and a new classic-contemporary menu. There’s also an interesting and reasonably priced three-dish menu at lunchtime, as well as the option of ordering an informal gastronomic picnic box. The beautiful natural setting of Cassinetta di Lugagnano and its canal completes the picture.
