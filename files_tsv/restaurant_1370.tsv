Il Refettorio	via Roma 2	Conca dei Marini	84010	Italy	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine	Housed within the Monastero Santa Rosa, one of the most original and iconic hotels on the Amalfi Coast (the monastery was founded in the 17C and some of its original features can still be seen), this restaurant occupies a spectacular terrace in a magical, tranquil setting with views that extend from the garden to the swimming pool and right out to sea. The cuisine comes courtesy of Alfonso Crescenzo, whose slogan “Nothing is more complex than simple cuisine” lies behind his tasteful reinterpretations of Campania’s traditional dishes, which are natural, full of generous flavours and beautifully presented. Our inspector recommends the turbot with bitter chicory, grouper soup, morel mushrooms and smoked provola cheese. There’s an equal balance of meat and fish options, with some vegetables sourced from the property’s own garden.
