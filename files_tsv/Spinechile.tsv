Spinechile	contra' Pacche 2	località Tretto	Schio	36015	€€€€	Creative	Situated in a magical location amid the wooded slops above Schio, this restaurant is not easy to find – even once you get to the village, you’ve still got a way to go! From here, you take a winding and occasionally narrow road, the last section of which is just a dirt track, continuing up to an altitude of 600m, where you eventually reach an elegant old mountain lodge. Corrado Fasolato, a talented and highly experienced chef, offers a menu that features classic dishes alongside more creative options. Guests flock here because of the restaurant’s reputation and leave delighted by new discoveries. The wine list is justly famous and is divided into three sections: one dedicated to white wines; another to red; and the third to sweet wines. Spinechile is run by life and business partners Corrado in the kitchen and wine expert Paola front of house.
