Bros'	via degli Acaja 2	Lecce	73100	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Bros' is a synonym for a young, free spirit which is full of creativity and imagination, where Floriano Pellegrino and Isabella Potì make the most of their extraordinary energy on two tasting menus that range from 20 to 23 small courses. Their cuisine features innovative and surprising tasting dishes made from local ingredients (many of the courses are finished with a theatrical flourish at your table), all the way through to the excellent desserts, the latter courtesy of Isabella Potì. To a background of modern music, guests are guided on a no-holds-barred journey through the personal gastronomic world of these two exciting chefs. An interesting wine list, which includes a selection of organic and biodynamic labels, and excellent service complete the picture.
