Sissi	via Galilei 44	Merano	39012	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,ClassicCuisine	Situated just outside the pedestrianised area of beautiful Merano, the main dining room of this restaurant has a welcoming feel and is decorated in attractive Art-Nouveau style. Here, owner-chef Andrea Fenoglio divides his time between the kitchen and front of house so that he can take time to chat with guests. His cuisine has solid classic foundations, with a good choice of dishes on the à la carte, plus a surprise tasting menu (Settepiatti ) which changes every year (as does the ceramic tableware on which it is served!). The cuisine is comforting and full of generous flavours, to which Fenoglio adds a light modern touch with his carefully chosen accompaniments and presentation. Whatever dish you choose, you can be sure of finding the perfect wine pairing for your meal on the skilfully constructed wine list.
