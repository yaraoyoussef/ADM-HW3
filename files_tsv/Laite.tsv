Laite	borgata Hoffe 10	Sappada	33012	Italy	€€€€	RegionalCuisine,TraditionalCuisine	Occupying a typical mountain property in a quiet district, this restaurant features two magnificent Stube-style rooms (one dating from the 17C, the other the 18C) decorated with a profusion of wood. The three menus have names (in local dialect) that sum up chef Fabrizia Meroi’s culinary vision. “Verpai” (something that flows quickly) is the shortest menu; “Asou” (“Così” in Italian, or “like this”) features the restaurant’s historic dishes; and “Plissn” (fir needles) showcases traditional recipes based on seasonal ingredients and the whims of the chef, with the occasional exotic twist (for example, catfish served with mountain dashi and shitake). Regional recipes and seasonal local ingredients take pride of place, accompanied by wines chosen with enthusiasm by Elena, Fabrizia’s daughter, including an excellent selection by the glass. Careful attention to flavour is the focus here rather than overly complex dishes, so that guests can enjoy the delicious food and head home with wonderful memories of this fabulous gourmet experience.
