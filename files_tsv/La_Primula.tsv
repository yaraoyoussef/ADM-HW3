La Primula	via San Rocco 47	San Quirino	33080	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary,Creative	Situated between Pordenone and Aviano in the magical Magredi region, this elegant restaurant – still run by the Canton family – celebrates its 150th birthday in 2023. The attractive, comfortable dining room is dominated by a fireplace and provides the setting for delicious meat and fish dishes prepared by Andrea Canton, whose cuisine is carefully prepared, occasionally imaginative and full of comforting flavours. The excellent wine is divided into three sections: one dedicated to the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, another to Italy as a whole, and the third to the rest of the world. The same building houses the Osteria alle Nazioni (also open at lunchtimes), where the cuisine is inspired by regional traditions.
