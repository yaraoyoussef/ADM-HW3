Osteria della Tana	località Kaberlaba 19	Asiago	36012	Italy	€€€	Venetian,TraditionalCuisine	Occupying the same red house as chef Alessandro Dal Degan’s gourmet restaurant, the Osteria is where this chef turns his attention to more traditional dishes (meat and fish alike), which are often typical of the Veneto. There’s one highly recommended exception, however, namely thecarbonara dell’Osteria, prepared with top-quality ingredients from the region. Also popular are thebaccalà alla vicentina(dried cod) and the tripe, both of which feature on a menu with a wide selection, including renowned dishes from the chef’s Michelin-starred restaurant. Full-bodied flavours that will delight the palate.
