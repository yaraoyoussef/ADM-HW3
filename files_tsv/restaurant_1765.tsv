Tre Noghere	via Crede 1	Bigolino	31049	Italy	€€	RegionalCuisine	Situated in a peaceful location amid fields and vineyards, this attractive country restaurant run by the same family since 1965 boasts an outdoor space where three walnut trees (“tre noghere”) provide shade in summer, plus a neat and simple dining room. The skilful owner is at the helm in the kitchen, while the younger generation provide a warm and professional welcome front of house. Traditional cuisine, including home-made pastas, are to the fore here – we particularly enjoyed the bigoli with ragu and rosemary, as well as the glazed duck breast with apricots. We asked for recommendations when choosing our wine and we didn’t regret it!
