Balzi Rossi	via Balzi Rossi 2	Ventimiglia	18039	Italy	€€€€	Countrycooking,Creative	Still in Italy but just a short distance from the French border, this restaurant boasts a spectacular terrace with views of the French coast that extend from Menton’s picturesque historic centre to Cap Martin (in high season, booking one of these much-coveted tables is recommended; the alternative is an attractive and elegant dining room). Despite the external focus on the French Riviera, talented chef Enrico Marmo’s cuisine brings us right back to Liguria. This young chef showcases top-quality regional ingredients such as Pigna beans and San Remo crayfish, and skilfully reinterprets Ligurian recipes with his own creative touch, sometimes offering two or more dishes based on the same theme. Choose from an extensive and creative surprise tasting menu or from a concise à la carte which includes specialities such as the Ravioli della Pina and the Ligurian-style roast rabbit that have featured on the menu since it opened in 1985. Here, the view, cuisine and interesting wine selection (ask enthusiastic sommelier Lorenzo for his recommendations) all come together to offer a truly unforgettable dining experience.
