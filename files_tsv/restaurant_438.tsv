Osteria a "Le Due Spade"	via Don Arcangelo Rizzi 11	Trento	38122	Italy	€€	ModernCuisine,Contemporary	This beautiful Stube-style restaurant in the city centre has existed since the Council of Trent, with a succession of chefs and owners serving food here ever since the 16C. Still run with skill and expertise today, the restaurant boasts a small, intimate Alpine-style dining room where Trento specialities (char, apple strudel with vanilla ice cream) are served alongside typical Italian fare (risotto with mussel power and parsley pesto). All the dishes are cooked with an imaginative touch, resulting in a perfect balance of tradition and modernity!
