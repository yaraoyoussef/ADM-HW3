Babette	via Michelangelo 17	Albenga	17031	Italy	€€	MediterraneanCuisine,Ligurian	Situated just beyond the centre of Albenga in a beautiful location right on the beach (with only a small private beach club separating it from the sea), this restaurant has been in business for over 20 years (10 years on this site, and 10 in the town centre before that). It is renowned for its excellent, modern cuisine that focuses on top-quality, fresh and seasonal fish. A lighter (yet equally excellent) menu is also available at lunchtime.
