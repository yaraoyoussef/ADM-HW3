Angiolina	via Passariello 2	località Marina di Pisciotta	Pisciotta	84066	€	Campanian,TraditionalCuisine	This trattoria is situated at the end of the marina in Pisciotta, a location which ensures a quiet, tranquil ambience. The excellent, reasonably priced seafood cuisine is another reason that we heartily recommend eating here. With a focus on local fish, the menu features a wide array of specialities from Campania, including anchovies served in different ways (stuffed, “alla scapece”, salted and served with butter, and with spaghetti).
