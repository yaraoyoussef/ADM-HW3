Anto e Robi	Piazza della Libertà 8	Robbio	27038	Italy	€€	MediterraneanCuisine	Situated in the heart of a small town surrounded by rice fields, this restaurant has a charming and personalised feel. The cuisine is often (but not always) based around fish, which is showcased in dishes inspired by regional traditions. While Robi oversees the front of house with skill and expertise, offering recommendations on wine (over 300 labels, including many by the glass) and rum (his particular passion), Anto prepares a host of delicious recipes in the kitchen.
