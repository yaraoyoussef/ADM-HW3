Mogano	via del Praticello Alto 7	Formello	60	Italy	€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Aiming to promote craft beers as a worthy pairing for gourmet cuisine, the Faenza family opened Mogano – a modern, elegant restaurant with a wood-inspired decor, soft lighting and just five tables, right next to their Ritual Lab brewery. One of the sons (Matteo, the chef here) greets guests before dinner with an aperitif served in the kitchen. With plenty of international culinary experience behind him, he combines Italian flavours with influences from all around the world. Despite the focus on beer, a wine list is also available.
