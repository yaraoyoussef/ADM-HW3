Osteria Acquarol	via Johann Georg Plazer 10	San Michele	39057	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,Alpine	Centrally located and with a plain, almost minimalist interior and a small charming outdoor space on the pedestrianised street for summer dining, Osteria Acquarol serves dishes which are strongly rooted in the region yet prepared with modern techniques and very much influenced by the character of the owner-chef here. Regionally sourced sustainable ingredients often feature in its highly original cuisine, including aromatic and wild herbs grown in the chef’s own garden. In 2023, the restaurant’s kitchen garden was extended so vegetables now play a more dominant role in the two tasting menus served here (seven and nine courses, with dishes that can be chosen à la carte style) – examples include the cold minestra soup entitled “L'orto dietro l'angolo” (“the garden around the corner”) and the unusual green tagliatelle with its carefully balanced bitter flavours. Originally from Cremona, chef Alessandro Bellingeri showcases the region in interesting and original ways.	Counter dining, Terrace	Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 0471 362932	https://www.acquarol.it/
