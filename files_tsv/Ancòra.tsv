Ancòra	viale Trento 31	Cesenatico	47042	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,ItalianContemporary	A new adventure for skilful chef Agostino Iacobucci (his original restaurant of the same name is in Castel Maggiore), housed within a villa that food-enthusiasts will remember as the former home of the two-Michelin-star Magnolia. In this elegant and welcoming setting, resident chef Marco Garattoni demonstrates the precise culinary techniques acquired during his many years working in top-quality restaurants. His dishes are contemporary, always colourful, beautifully presented, pleasing and attractive, even mouthwatering at times, and mostly based on fish, with the addition of a few vegetarian and meat options. Don’t miss one of this Neapolitan chef’s most famous signature dishes, namely his “babà a tre lievitazioni”, which is light, delicious and perfect in every way!
