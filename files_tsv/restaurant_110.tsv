Il Santo Bevitore	via Santo Spirito 64/66 r	Florence	50125	Italy	€€	Tuscan	Both the simple, friendly atmosphere and the cuisine served at this restaurant are typical of a Tuscan trattoria. The menu features classic favourites from Tuscany (highlights include pappa al pomodoro and cured hams), which are full of the strong traditional flavours that you would expect to find in Florence and are occasionally reinterpreted in more contemporary dishes. For guests keen to take a culinary souvenir home with them, the Santino delicatessen is just next door.		Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 055 211264
