Il Fagiano	corso Zanardelli 190	Fasano del Garda	25083	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary,Creative	Maurizio Bufi is at the helm of this restaurant, where he creates seasonal regional cuisine that is full of flavour. The extensive options include four tasting menus: Frammenti(the chef’s most iconic dishes), Sensazioni (more creative in style), Equinozio d'autunno(as the name suggests, this menu has an autumnal focus), and Dalla terra(interesting vegetarian options). The atmosphere here is elegant and stylish, whether you sit out on the beautiful terrace in summer or in the warm, atmospheric dining room with its charming coffered ceiling in winter. We particularly enjoyed the iconic fusillone pasta with cuttlefish carpaccio and a Jerusalem artichoke velouté, which was sweet and delicate, and paired with a fresh and intense white Planeta Eruzione 1614 Carricante.
