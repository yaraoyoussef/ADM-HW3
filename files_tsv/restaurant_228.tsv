Fratelli Bruzzone	via Maria Vittoria 34/a	Turin	10123	Italy	€	Piedmontese	The Bruzzone brothers deserve a round of applause for this restaurant and its extraordinary traditional Piedmontese cuisine. In just two small dining rooms (booking is recommended), guests can choose from an unforgettable array of dishes including anchovies in green sauce, baked onions with bagna cauda (an anchovy-based dip), superb agnolotti (stuffed pasta), tripe, chicken, bonet (a type of dessert) and hazelnut tart with zabaglione. With so much choice, it’s difficult to stop eating – and once you’ve left, you’ll want to return as soon as possible!
