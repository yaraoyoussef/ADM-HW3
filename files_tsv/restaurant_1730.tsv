Il Sereno Al Lago	via Torrazza 10	Torno	22020	Italy	€€€€	Creative	Coming off the street that dissects the village, you head down almost as far as the lakeshore to this restaurant situated in the luxury Il Sereno hotel, an elegant and brand-new property designed by the inventive architect di Patricia Urquiola. In summer, meals are served on the arched terrace, where the view takes in the blue waters of the lake and the small villages on the opposite shore. The superb creative skills of the brilliant Neapolitan chef are expressed with consummate ease and balance in many different types of cuisine, including regional specialities, vegan options, Asian-influenced dishes, the occasional nod to Lombardy and fish from the lake. Options include tasting menus and an à la carte.
