Palais Royal Restaurant	Calle Larga 22 Marzo 2032	Venice	30124	Italy	€€€€	Creative,MediterraneanCuisine	This restaurant is an Italian offshoot of the award-winning Palais Royal in Paris. To the delight of gourmet food-lovers, Greek chef Philip Chronopoulos now also serves his delicious gastronomic creations in Venice, in this restaurant in the Nolinski hotel housed in the former Palazzo della Borsa. The elliptical dining room, with a muffled ambience thanks to its beautiful carpet, has a charm of its own, which lightly harks back to the 1950s. Here, guests have a choice of two tasting menus which showcase cuisine with a Mediterranean flavour, French techniques, numerous Greek influences (including the opening course which reinterprets classic recipes), and Italian ingredients. Top-quality options such as lobster and caviar are prepared with precision and served with real skill – it comes as no surprise to learn that Philip previously worked with renowned chefs such as Joël Robuchon and Alain Passard. An excellent new address for the Venetian Lagoon!	Air conditioning	Amex, Mastercard, Visa	+39 041 406259	https://nolinskivenezia.com/it/palais-royal-restaurant-gastronomico/
