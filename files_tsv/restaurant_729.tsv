Marc Lanteri	Via Serra 21/d	Castagnito d'Alba	12050	Italy	€€	Piedmontese,Contemporary	Situated right next to the Fratelli Massucco winery, with which it shares its comfortable outdoor spaces as well as stunning views of the surrounding hills and vineyards, this restaurant is run by Marc Lanteri and Amy Bellotti, partners in life and work, who have chosen this setting for their new Piedmontese adventure. Their cuisine is full of individual character, with three tasting menus (including a vegetarian option featuring produce grown in their own garden) and dishes also available à la carte style. Local ingredients and recipes naturally take centre stage, always enhanced by small touches of colour and imagination. The wine list showcases the property’s own wines, as well as offering a choice of labels from elsewhere in Italy and further afield.
