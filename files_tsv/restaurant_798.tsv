Lux Lucis	viale A. Morin 67	Forte dei Marmi	55042	Italy	€€€€	Creative,ItalianContemporary	A lift takes guests up to the roof garden of this restaurant housed in the Principe Forte dei Marmi hotel, where a terrace provides the perfect setting for an aperitif with its enchanting views of the coast and (if you’re lucky) beautiful sunsets. From here, you move into the dining room preceded by an open-view kitchen. Originally from the hills around Modena, the chef here likes to include Emilian touches in his perfectly presented dishes. The wine list has an unusual layout, with wines listed according to grape variety and each one accompanied by an interesting description.
