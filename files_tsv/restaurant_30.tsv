La Tavola	via Fortino 40	Laveno	21014	Italy	€€€€	Creative	Situated in the Il Porticciolo hotel, this restaurant will appeal to anyone who enjoys a lakeside setting. Leave your car in the car park, then take the lift down to the dining room with its windows overlooking the water and views of the opposite shore of Lake Maggiore. The lake also takes pride of place in some of the creative, elaborate and personalised dishes on the two tasting menus created by Riccardo Bassetti, many of which feature freshwater fish.
