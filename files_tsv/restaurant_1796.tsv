Il Falconiere	Località San Martino a Bocena 370	San Martino	52044	Italy	€€€€	Tuscan,Contemporary	To get to this exclusive restaurant, you drive through an idyllic landscape of small lanes lined with dry-stone walls and fields belonging to the Baracchi farm estate, of which Il Falconiere and the magnificent hotel of the same name are a part. Many of the ingredients served here, such as wine and olive oil, are produced on the estate and the restaurant’s strong connection with its local landscapes is evident. Specialities such as Chianina beef, local garlic and pici pasta feature in dishes spiced with aromatic herbs and full of the strong flavours of Tuscany.
