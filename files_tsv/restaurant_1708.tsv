Damini Macelleria & Affini	via Cadorna 31	Arzignano	36071	Italy	€€€	MeatsandGrills,ModernCuisine	Gourmet food, a wine boutique and luxury butcher’s shop all in one, this restaurant serves remarkable produce and delicious cuisine at the tables behind its gleaming windows, while its wide selection of wines is announced at your table by the owner himself. Without doubt, this is a highly original gourmet experience in which respect for ingredients and culinary expertise results in strong, enticing flavours. It’s no surprise that particular attention is paid to the choice of meat, much of which comes from the restaurant’s own farm in Trezzo sull’Adda: meat is aged on site, with the duration depending on the type of meat (up to 100 days for the famousGallegaandWagyu). Here, the cuisine appeals directly to the heart and the senses!
