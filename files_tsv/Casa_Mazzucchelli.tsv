Casa Mazzucchelli	via Porrettana 291	Sasso Marconi	40037	Italy	€€€	Creative	At certain times of day, the tempting aroma of freshly baked bread greets you as soon as you step into this restaurant, leaving you in no doubt as to the nature of the restaurant’s newest venture. Other dishes are also baked in the oven here, such as wild boar served with a red wine babà and sage mayonnaise. There are two tasting menus available (Attimi di cucina and Momento contemporaneo), both of which showcase traditionally influenced cuisine full of distinct flavours.
