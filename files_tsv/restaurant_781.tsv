Teresa	piazza Lido di Pegli 5 r	Pegli	16156	Italy	€€€	Seafood,ModernCuisine	Over half a century has passed since this restaurant was opened in 1968 by “mamma” Teresa and “papa” Giuseppe – and it’s still going strong! And although the staff here are proud of the restaurant’s long history and sense of tradition, they are not bound by it, as demonstrated by dishes that have successfully moved with the times, incorporating modern touches to the classic recipes, while always retaining a focus on fresh, high-quality ingredients (especially when it comes to choosing fish).
