Giano	via Liguria 28	Rome	187	Italy	€€€	MediterraneanCuisine	Conveniently situated in a quiet setting just behind Via Vittorio Veneto, Giano is housed within the modern Hotel W with which it shares a comfortable cocktail bar and attractive garden. The atmosphere here is modern and informal, with simple fare served at lunchtime and more gourmet dining options in the evening. The resident chef is supported by skilful and experienced Ciccio Sultano who provides valuable input on menus and ingredients. Iconic dishes such as the spaghetto taratatà (with a tuna and bottarga sauce), the em>caponada, and the carpacci are highly recommended, as are desserts such as the reinterpreted millefoglie . Sicilian cuisine takes pride of place here and the service is excellent.
