Romano	via Mazzini 120	Viareggio	55049	Italy	€€€€	Seafood	Opened in 1966, Romano is a real culinary institution in the Versilia region, serving cuisine made from top-quality ingredients, with a particular focus on local fish. Although its philosophy has not changed over the years, current chef Nicola Gronchi should be applauded for adding a hint of contemporary flavour and technical expertise to the cuisine, while still retaining everything that this restaurant does best, namely serving fish of the highest quality (there are also a few meat dishes), including the occasional typical Versilian recipe.
