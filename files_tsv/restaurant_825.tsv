Enoteca Del Duca	via di Castello 2	Volterra	56048	Italy	€€	ClassicCuisine,Tuscan	Despite the change of ownership at this centrally located restaurant right behind the castle and the main square, there’s a certain continuity to the cuisine which remains focused on classic dishes with a regional flavour (with the option of steak on the menu). The dining room features old stone walls, plus there’s also an attractive outdoor space for summer dining.	['Terrace', 'Wheelchair access']	['Amex', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0588 81510	nan
