Villa Elena	via San Vigilio 56	Bergamo	24129	Italy	€€€€	Creative	Situated near the Città Alta in a delightful setting surrounded by hills, Villa Elena is one of the most sumptuous villas in the countryside around Bergamo. Housed in a 16C building with a medieval tower and a terrace-cum-garden, the restaurant boasts a stunning interior decor of stucco, marble, mirrors and frescoes. This luxurious ambience is more than equalled by the fine cuisine created by Marco Galtarossa in partnership with Enrico Bartolini (the Italian chef with the largest number of Michelin stars). The occasionally elaborate dishes are sometimes divided into several courses, and combined with a clever use of aromatic herbs, all of which makes this the perfect choice for a memorable meal and special occasion.
