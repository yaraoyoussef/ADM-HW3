L'Asinello	via Nuova 6, località Villa a Sesta	Castelnuovo Berardenga	53019	Italy	€€€	Tuscan,Creative	Situated at the entrance to a romantic village in the Chianti region, this former stable has been converted into a quiet, elegant restaurant by a young couple, with a beautiful garden for summer dining. Here, guests can sit after dinner and enjoy the sound of neighbours calling to each other in the background, a pleasant reminder of life in Italy in days gone by. At the helm in the kitchen, the husband champions traditional cuisine which is minimalist in its choice of flavours and made from just a few well-balanced ingredients. The impeccably kept garden, which is as beautiful and well presented as his dishes, is also the chef’s work (he certainly has green fingers!). A real Italian culinary gem!
