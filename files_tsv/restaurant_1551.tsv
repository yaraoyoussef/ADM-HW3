Il Papavero	corso Garibaldi 112/113	Eboli	84025	Italy	€€	ModernCuisine,Campanian	Papavero is the Italian for poppy, a plant which grows tall and has strong roots, making it an apt symbol for this restaurant housed in a palazzo in the town centre. In a few classic-style rooms, the chef offers a menu that focuses on fish and seafood, although ingredients from the surrounding countryside also feature. Simple, solid recipes made with just a few ingredients, exactly as described on the menu, and a passionate dedication to the Mediterranean result in attractive cuisine which also offers good value for money. In fine weather, meals are served outdoors under the jasmine in a romantic garden. A restaurant that appeals to the heart as well as the palate.
