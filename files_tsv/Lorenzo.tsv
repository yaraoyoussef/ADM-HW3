Lorenzo	via Carducci 61	Forte dei Marmi	55042	Italy	€€€€	Seafood,Italian	This gastronomic institution has been an emblem of the Versilia region for the past 40 years, ever since it opened in 1981, and is now proudly run by daughter Chiara, an expert sommelier who, together with her staff, ensures that guests enjoy the best possible experience. Surrounded by contemporary works of art which change regularly (a passion inherited from great-grandfather Lorenzo after whom the restaurant is named), guests are guaranteed a fine dining experience thanks to the superb quality of the fish served here. The menu features iconic dishes and classic favourites such as warm seafood salad with shellfish served with seasonal vegetables, and top-quality scampi (baked or steamed) accompanied by mayonnaise that is freshly made in front of guests at their table. The wine cellar is also worthy of praise, with its two wine lists (one dedicated to Italy, the other to non-Italian wines) and a particular focus on French labels, especially from Champagne and Burgundy.
