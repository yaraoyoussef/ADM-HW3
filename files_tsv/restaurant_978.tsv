La Dispensa di Armatore	via Cantone 1	Cetara	84010	Italy	€	Seafood,Campanian	A very small and unusual restaurant with a bistro feel and tables outside only, either at the counter with stools overlooking the sea or in the more traditional outdoor dining space. Although the menu is relatively small, the quality of the fish (including options such as bluefin tuna, anchovies, squid etc) is excellent – which is hardly surprising, as the restaurant owners have been involved in the fishing industry for four generations. The menu features just one dessert, “spumone”, which is made for the restaurant by a nearby artisanal ice-cream parlour, and the restaurant doesn’t serve coffee, but people flock here for the excellent fish and the attractive prices, which are very reasonable given its coastal location.
