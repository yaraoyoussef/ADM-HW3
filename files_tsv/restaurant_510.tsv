Esplanade	via Lario 3	Desenzano del Garda	25015	Italy	€€€€	Italian,ModernCuisine	One of Italy’s long-established restaurants, the Esplanade has been a proud holder of a Michelin star since 1992 and is so renowned among food-lovers that its name is practically synonymous with that of Desenzano del Garda. Boasting a superb location alongside the lake, from which it is separated only by its own garden (the summer outdoor space is delightful), it is equally famous for its top-quality cuisine. The menu is one of the most extensive (at this level) in Italy, with an equal balance of meat and fish, and Italian and regional dishes prepared using mainly seasonal ingredients – this is classic Italian cuisine that does not stray too far from its traditional roots yet with delicate modern touches added by chef Massimo Fezzardi. The dining room, where the attentive service is as precise as a metronome, is overseen by two superb characters, namely Marzio Lee Vallio, the sommelier who won the 2024 Michelin Guide Italy Sommelier Award, and the exuberant and flawless Emanuele Signorini, a true professional whose friendly manner is contagious.
