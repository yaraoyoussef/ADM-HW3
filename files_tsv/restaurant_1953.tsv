Materia	via Trieste 1/B	Cernobbio	22012	Italy	€€€	Creative	Moved to via Trieste 1/b - Cernobbio.  The cuisine is a fusion of Italian, Asian and other influences, with a menu featuring plenty of vegetables, spices and aromatic herbs that the chef uses to create dishes full of concentrated flavours. If you enjoy innovative and original combinations, this is the restaurant for you as many of the dishes on the menu (including the desserts) offer something different, including recipes with more challenging and acidic and bitter flavours. Our inspector particularly enjoyed the pickled whitefish served with roe and bitter local salad leaves. In addition to the à la carte, there’s also a lighter menu available at lunchtime.
