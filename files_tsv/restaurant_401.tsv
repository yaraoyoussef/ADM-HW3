Terrazza Costantino	rione Sant'Antonio 24	Sclafani Bagni	90020	Italy	€€	Countrycooking,ModernCuisine	In just a few years, young owner-chef Giuseppe Costantino has turned what was once the family trattoria into an elegant restaurant serving delicious reinterpretations of local specialities. There is just one tasting menu which features either meat or fish (although this can be discussed when you make your booking, which is essential). Given the excellent quality of the food here, this menu offers exceptional value for money.
