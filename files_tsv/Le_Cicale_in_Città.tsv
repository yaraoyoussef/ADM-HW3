Le Cicale in Città	via Macaggi 53	Genoa	16121	Italy	€€€	Seafood,Italian	A classic-style dining room adorned with mirrors and silverware acts as the backdrop for fish and seafood dishes at this restaurant. The raw fish is particularly excellent, as are the mupa (a little-known fish that lives in the deep waters of the Mediterranean), prawns (in season) and home-made primi served with delicious sauces, such as the chicken plin with brown gravy. For special occasions, we recommend the table to the rear of the room near the arte povera-style dresser. Cheerful, friendly service adds to the appeal.
