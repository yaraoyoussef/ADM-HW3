L'antica Pizzeria da Michele	via Cesare Sersale 1/7	Naples	80139	Italy	€	Pizza	You can really sense the history of Naples in this pizzeria, which was founded in 1870 and boasts a lively, convivial atmosphere – if you sit alone, you’re sure to find yourself sharing travellers’ tales with fellow diners by the end of your meal! Note that the restaurant only serves two types of pizza – Margherita (tomato and mozzarella) and Marinara (tomato, oregano and garlic). Numbered tickets are issued to diners, who then take a seat and are called in turn (open all day). A second restaurant has recently been opened nearby.
