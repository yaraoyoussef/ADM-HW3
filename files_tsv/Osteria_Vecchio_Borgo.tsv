Osteria Vecchio Borgo	via Dronero 8/b	Cuneo	12100	Italy	€€	Countrycooking	Described as a “meeting point between Piedmont and Liguria”, this quiet, welcoming restaurant in the historic centre of Cuneo focuses on ingredients and recipes from these two regions – the family, all of whom are involved in the restaurant (the women in the kitchen and the men front of house), are from Liguria. The generous, top-quality cuisine is prepared using seasonal produce with a personalised touch and is accompanied by a good selection of wine, also available by the glass.
