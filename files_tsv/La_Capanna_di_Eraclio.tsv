La Capanna di Eraclio	Località per Le Venezie 21	Codigoro	44021	Italy	€€€	Seafood	Whenever we visit Capanna di Eraclio, we have the strange yet wonderful feeling of coming home. Opened in 1922 and now in the hands of the fourth generation of the family, this restaurant has changed little – to our relief – since the time when a kitchen was first added to the inn that already stood here. The atmosphere is that of a simple, traditional family trattoria, yet with unexpected touches of elegance. The cuisine, meanwhile, focuses on the best ingredients that the Po delta has to offer, from scallops and small sole to superb eel and blue crab served steamed in its shell to bring out its full flavours, with a fresh mayonnaise on the side. It's interesting to note that this unique restaurant is situated seven metres below sea level!	['Air conditioning', 'Car park', 'Terrace']	['Amex', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0533 712154
