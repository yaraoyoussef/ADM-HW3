Di Martino Sea Front Pasta Bar	piazza Municipio 1	Naples	80133	Italy	€€	Italian	Situated opposite the Maschio Angioino (Castel Nuovo) in Naples, this restaurant was opened by a pasta producer from nearby Gragnano, making it the perfect choice for pasta-lovers. Sit at a sushi-style counter watching the chefs at work and choose from a menu that is dedicated almost entirely to pasta dishes (as well as desserts), most of which are based on traditional recipes. When ordered individually, the dishes are generously portioned; however, for a more complete overview, opt for the tasting menu which includes more courses but smaller quantities.
