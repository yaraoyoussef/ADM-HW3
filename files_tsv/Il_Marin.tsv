Il Marin	Calata Cattaneo	15	Edificio Millo	Porto Antico	€€€	Seafood,Contemporary	Situated at the old port, in the same building and on the same floor as Eataly, this restaurant is simple in style so that nothing detracts from the view through its floor-to-ceiling windows. The cuisine focuses on regional traditions while reinterpreting these with modern ideas and techniques. Examples include a “spaghetti Martini cocktail”, which is shaken at your table by the chef and made with Martini bitters and creamed olives flavoured with a misted extra virgin Taggiasca gin, and tortelli with a sauce made with fishheads, guts and bones and a pleasant hint of marjoram to add a final touch of flavour.
