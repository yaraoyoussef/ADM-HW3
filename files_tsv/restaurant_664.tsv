Da Orlando	piazza Soncino 19	Cusago	20090	Italy	€€	Italian	Simply arriving in Cusago near Milan, where the imposing castle dominates the attractive centre, puts you in a good mood. At Da Orlando, the menu is equally balanced between top-quality fish dishes such as the “bollita di mare” and meat-based dishes that will delight food-lovers, such as snails with trumpet mushrooms and duck breast with ginger. Two elegant dining rooms are the perfect setting for a romantic evening, while the attractive outdoor space comes into its own in summer. A good restaurant with over 40 years of history.
