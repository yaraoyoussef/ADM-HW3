28 Posti	via Corsico 1	Milan	20144	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine	The main focus of 28 Posti is its ethical stance, with seasonal ingredients sourced from small producers and an emphasis on making the most of each and every ingredient in order to keep food waste to a minimum – a philosophy that has been important to the restaurant for many years now. New chefs Franco Salvatore and Andrea Zazzara, both from the Abruzzi, have brought their own personal touches to cuisine which has its roots in the rich gastronomic traditions of central Italy and their native region.
