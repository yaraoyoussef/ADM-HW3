Cracco in Galleria	Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II	Milan	20121	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine,Contemporary	The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is one of the most iconic sights in Milan and as such it is apt that it is home to this star of Italian cuisine. Cracco is not just a gourmet restaurant – it’s also a bistro and an excellent pastry shop which is open all day, with separate spaces for special events on the top floor. At the helm in the kitchen, chef Luca Sacchi (ably assisted by owner Carlo) creates top-quality cuisine with impeccable technique, inspired by the culinary traditions of Milan and the broader Mediterranean with fish from Liguria taking pride of place on the menu – the chef also has a new restaurant in Portofino. The wine list is an experience in itself, offering one of the best and most comprehensive selections of French wines in Italy, as well as an excellent choice of wines by the glass. Guests also have the opportunity to taste wines from the organic Vistamare estate situated in the Romagnole hills. The professional career of the chef at Cracco is one of the most impressive in Italy, with influences that include the culinary master Alain Ducasse and wine expert Giorgio Pinchiorri. The most popular tables are those by the window with views of the Ottagono building.
