D.One Restaurant	via del Borgo 1	Montepagano	64026	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,Countrycooking	The location of this restaurant is certainly unique, offering different spaces for different parts of your meal (aperitif, dinner, tastings etc). Here, chef Davide Pezzuto from Salento blends simplicity with creative experimentation, sourcing his fish from the nearby Adriatic and other ingredients from the restaurant’s own farm, including vegetables, wine, olive oil, cereals (ground in a water mill) and eggs. Demonstrating commendable personal involvement, the restaurant plays an important role in maintaining the gastronomic and historic traditions of the small town. The wine selection is also unusual: although it’s presented in the traditional way, it also highlights some of the local area’s “heroic” producers.
