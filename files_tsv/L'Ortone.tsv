L'Ortone	piazza Lorenzo Ghiberti 87 r	Florence	50122	Italy	€€	Italian,SeasonalCuisine	This Tuscan-style bistro next to Sant'Ambrogio market is simple both in its decor and cuisine, offering a menu which features a few regional dishes alongside imaginative Italian-themed options prepared from seasonal ingredients. Grilled specialities are also available, alongside an interesting wine list. Excellent value for money, although if you order the steak you’ll end up spending a little more.
