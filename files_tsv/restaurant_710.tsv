Il Gallo Cedrone	via Cima Tosa 80	Madonna di Campiglio	38086	Italy	€€€	Creative,Contemporary	With its classic Alpine appeal and wood and stone decor, Il Gallo Cedrone at the Bertelli hotel is still at the top of its game! With ever-growing confidence, Sabino Fortunato continues to celebrate the mountain in his cuisine – through the use of game, freshwater fish, cooking with hay and cheese etc – as well as remaining open to influences from the Mediterranean and elsewhere in Italy. His dishes are always well structured and prepared from many different ingredients, which he skilfully combines to produce the best flavours. The inspiration for his “History of venison and ChatGPT in the Parco dello Stelvio with pomegranate, celery, pepper and juniper” dish is the region’s deer management plan and responsible venison consumption. The excellent wine cellar is home to over 800 different labels carefully selected by owner Marco Masè alongside long-established sommelier Giuseppe Greco, plus a wide array of gin and tonics.
