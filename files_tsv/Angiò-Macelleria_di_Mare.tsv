Angiò-Macelleria di Mare	viale Africa 28/h	Catania	95129	Italy	€€	Seafood	The phrase “macellaria di mare” translates as “fish and seafood butcher’s”, a reference to the cured and seasoned fish that features on the menu here. The restaurant offers an original formula in which guests chat to the chef and choose their dish at the counter where ingredients are displayed, before taking a seat in the simple yet attractive dining room with its open-view kitchen. Our advice is to give young chef Alberto Angiolucci free reign – the result is a new take on fish and seafood cuisine.
