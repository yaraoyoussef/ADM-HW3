Atelier Moessmer Norbert Niederkofler	via Walther Von der Vogelweide 17	Brunico	39031	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Alpine	Situated in a vast historic park near the centre of Brunico, this restaurant occupies a villa that was once part of the Moessmer textile factory – to illustrate the fact, an interesting fabric book dating from the early 20C is displayed on a large central table in the dining room. Here, the chef’s “Cook the Mountain” philosophy takes centre stage with a focus on top-quality produce sourced from the surrounding mountains, and a seasonal approach which ensures that flavours and ingredients are always at their best. Dinner starts with delicious appetisers served in the small lounge, perhaps accompanied by an aperitif. Having enjoyed this delicious prelude, you then move to the dining room or to the counter with its stools facing the kitchen. Wherever you choose to sit, you continue with the chef’s single tasting menu – a series of superb dishes that confirm this chef from the Ahrntal valley as one of the masters of contemporary Italian cuisine.
