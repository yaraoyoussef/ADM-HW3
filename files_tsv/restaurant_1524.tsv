Apostelstube	via rio Bianco 4	Brixen	39042	Italy	€€€€	Creative,International	Situated in delightful Bressanone, the historic Elephant hotel occupies the oldest part of a late-15C building and is one of the icons of the town (it’s been run by the same family since 1773 and is now in the hands of the eighth generation). The hotel’s first-floor Apostelstube restaurant serves innovative cuisine in an intimate dining room with just four tables and statuettes of the apostles adorning the walls, hence the name. In summer, aperitifs are served in the attractive garden. A delightful welcome is offered front of house by the friendly and efficient Michael and Eleonora, whose theatrical flair helps to make your evening even more memorable, while the imaginative tasting menu created by Mathias Bachmann showcases techniques and ingredients from across the globe, with a particular passion for Japan (hamachi, shiso and red shiso, wasabi). The young chef is a welcome addition to this old hotel, where his personality shines through his exciting, contemporary cuisine.
