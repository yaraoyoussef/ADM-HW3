Glass Hostaria	vicolo del Cinque 58	Rome	00153	Italy	€€€€	Creative	In the heart of popular Trastevere with its many restaurants, Glass comes as a surprise, housed in what was once a coach-house (as the high ceilings still demonstrate) and now an elegant restaurant (if you want more privacy, there are a few tables set up on the mezzanine). Cristina Bowerman offers a choice of tasting menus (one of which is vegetarian) and a limited selection of à la carte dishes. Her cuisine is creative, with the occasional nod to the culinary traditions of Lazio. The excellent wine list also includes a choice of liqueurs and spirits.
