Don Alfonso 1890	corso Sant'Agata 11	Sant'Agata sui Due Golfi	80061	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Italian	In Sant'Agata, poised between two gulfs, Don Alfonso represents an image of southern Italy, the family and Mediterranean cuisine found in few other restaurants. Boasting an enchanting garden, splendid guestrooms and an elegant dining room, Don Alfonso 1890’s reputation was established by Livia and Alfonso, who are still here, greeting guests as though they were old friends. They have now been joined by their sons Ernesto and Mario (the former in the kitchen and the latter front of house). The legendary wine list, as well as a good selection of spirits, plus the organic kitchen garden at Punta Campanella which provides many of the vegetables on the menu, add to one of the most beautiful family stories in Italian gastronomy.
