Da Attilio	via Pignasecca 17	Naples	80134	Italy	€	Pizza	Situated in one of the liveliest working-class neighbourhoods of Naples, this restaurant serves traditional Neapolitan pizzas, including a few unusual innovations such as pizzas in the shape of an 8-pointed star. In business since 1938 and now run by the third generation of the same family, Da Attilio has just a few tables arranged in two small dining rooms and doesn’t take reservations. Although you may have to wait at the busiest times of day, you’ll find the wait well worthwhile!	['Air conditioning']	['Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 081 552 0479
