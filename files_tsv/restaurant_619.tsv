La Leggenda dei Frati	costa San Giorgio 6/a	Florence	50125	Italy	€€€€	Creative	After an uphill approach if you’re arriving here on foot, you come into the Villa Bardini museum complex and from there into this elegant and welcoming restaurant which provides the setting for delicious, creative and modern cuisine. Here, chef Filippo Saporito, never one to rest on his laurels, continues to experiment and perfect his cuisine, which focuses mainly on Italian culinary traditions and a scrupulous selection of top-quality ingredients, preferably from sustainable supply chains (various types of meat, bread and pasta), all showcased on different menus, including a vegetarian option. In summer, enjoy your meal on the romantic terrace surrounded by greenery and the scents of herbs, with a glimpse of Santa Croce church as a backdrop. Although the centre of Florence is not far away, it seems as though you’re already in the Tuscan hills, even with the occasional sound of cicadas in the background.
