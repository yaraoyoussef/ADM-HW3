Rimulas	via Severino Grattoni 8	Voghera	27058	Italy	€€	Innovative,Lombardian	At this restaurant situated just a stone’s throw from Piazza Duomo in the historic centre of Voghera, a young chef and his charming wife (who supervises the front of house) are renowned for their reasonably priced excellent cuisine. The chef’s skilfully and imaginatively prepared dishes bear witness to his extensive experience working elsewhere in Italy and further afield. The decor is contemporary, with just a few minimalist-style tables and a hushed ambience.	Air conditioning, Wheelchair access	Mastercard, Visa	+39 0383 175 0434	https://rimulas.it/
