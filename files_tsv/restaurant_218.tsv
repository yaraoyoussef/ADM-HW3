Terrazza Danieli	riva degli Schiavoni	sestiere Castello 4196	Venice	30122	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine	Mirrors and fabrics add to the luxurious atmosphere in the dining room at this restaurant, but it is the outdoor terrace (open between May and October) with its 180° views of the lagoon and islands that is its crowning glory. The menu changes regularly in line with the seasons, and features fresh, local ingredients with the occasional hint of exotic spices as is only fitting for Venice!
