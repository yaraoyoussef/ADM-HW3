Luigi Lepore	via Ubaldo de' Medici 50	Lamezia Terme	88046	Italy	€€€	Creative,Calabrian	Although you hardly notice the door to this restaurant from outside, once inside you are immediately struck by the modern elegance of the decor with its vaguely Scandinavian feel. This mini gem occupying a 19C palazzo in Nicastro, the historic centre of Lamezia, is home to owner-chef Luigi Lepore who has returned to his native Calabria after gaining impressive experience in France and Italy. Here, he delights guests with the best regional ingredients which he precisely and skilfully transforms into contemporary dishes with a fine balance of bitter and acidic flavours, and an intriguing hint of citrus fruit. There’s no à la carte, just three tasting menus: Origini (five courses) and A Mano Libera (available with either seven or nine courses). Diners are warmly welcomed with a smile by the chef’s sister, Stefania, who oversees the front of house and describes her brother’s dishes to guests.
