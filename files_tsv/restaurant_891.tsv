Il Rivale in Città	via Antonio Gramsci 10	Brescia	25122	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary	Situated in a beautiful 18C palazzo right in the centre of Brescia, this elegant restaurant consists of several small dining rooms of different colours, fabrics and furnishings yet all with the same historic atmosphere – the room with just one table is truly intimate! The cuisine features substantial recipes with a contemporary Italian flavour including top-quality options such as potato puff pastry, scampi, caviar and hazelnut cream, while one of the highlights of the new formula is the wooden dessert trolley on which a selection of tempting home-made delicacies is presented. The wine list (easily consulted on a tablet) is also impressive, with a particular focus on labels from nearby Franciacorta.
