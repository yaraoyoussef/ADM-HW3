Osteria di Passignano	via Passignano 33	Passignano	50028	Italy	€€€€	Countrycooking,ModernCuisine	Part of the Antinori estate, this restaurant has an elegant feel despite describing itself as an “osteria” (a more informal inn). It occupies an old site next to the old Badia di Passignano abbey after which it is named, and in whose wine cellars some of Antinori’s best Chianti is laid to age. This charming setting is full of history and references to wine. In the kitchen, the young chef maintains strong connections with the region and its wine, creating a menu with a resolutely seasonal focus. The personalised dishes are modern and cleverly designed to make full use of the property’s two stand-out features – the abbey’s beautiful kitchen garden which provides the chef with his herbs and vegetables, and the wine list which is truly impressive. The Tuscan wines are particularly notable, especially the legendary labels from the restaurant’s own winery.
