Fiorfiore	località Chioano	Todi	6059	Italy	€€	Umbrian,ModernCuisine	This restaurant occupying an elegant villa in a panoramic location with views of Todi and the surrounding countryside serves modern cuisine with its roots in Umbrian tradition. The extra-virgin olive oil comes from directly from the estate, as does some of the wine; there’s also an interesting selection of champagnes. Our inspector recommends the roast suckling pig accompanied by rosemary-flavoured potatoes, as well as the hazelnut cream, yoghurt sorbet and warm chocolate foam dessert. Quiet, comfortable guestrooms complete the picture.
