Amo Bistrot	Vicoletto Due Mori 5	Verona	37121	Italy	€€	Fusion	Traditional features such as exposed stone walls and wooden ceilings provide a pleasant contrast to the contemporary-style furnishings at this restaurant housed in the charming Palazzo Forti, while the attractive cloister with its old walls and soft lighting is highly recommended in the hot summer months. The cuisine combines traditional meat and fish dishes with Asian fare, including the option of sharing small dishes such as tapas or bao (steamed buns). There’s also an excellent brunch on Sundays.
