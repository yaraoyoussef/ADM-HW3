Oseleta	località Cordevigo	Cavaion Veronese	37010	Italy	€€€	Creative,Contemporary	Situated just a few kilometres from Garda on gently sloping hills planted with vineyards, Villa Cordevigo, home to the Oseleta restaurant, is approached via a superb avenue of cypress trees. There are two small dining rooms here – we recommend booking a table in the elegant veranda with picture windows offering views of the verdant countryside and swimming pool, where the service is impeccable. Chef Marco Marras demonstrates his culinary skills on a menu that features fish, vegetarian dishes, specialities from the lake and meat options, all beautifully presented and prepared with surgical precision. Cheese-lovers will appreciate the small yet well-chosen selection of Italian cheeses.
