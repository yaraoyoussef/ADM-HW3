I 5 Campanili	via Maino 18	Busto Arsizio	21052	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine	Contemporary cooking with an emphasis on Mediterranean fare in tune with the seasons is to the fore in this elegant restaurant occupying a 20C building with an attractive veranda to the rear. Fish takes pride of place on the menu, with a particular focus on raw dishes and shellfish, but the splendid desserts are also worthy of note, such as cherries in sour cherry juice with fior di latte ice cream.
