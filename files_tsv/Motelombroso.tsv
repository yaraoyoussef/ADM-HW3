Motelombroso	Alzaia Naviglio Pavese 256	Milan	20142	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,Creative	An old, carefully restored road worker’s house on the Alzaia Naviglio Pavese canal is the setting for this modern, stylish restaurant where Alessandra and Matteo welcome guests in a graceful, elegant and yet informal manner. The menu features contemporary meat and fish dishes accompanied by a good choice of wines. If you’re curious about the restaurant’s name, ask the owners for an explanation: could it be something to do with the private dining room perhaps?
