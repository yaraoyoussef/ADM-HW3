Olmo	Piazza della Chiesa 7	loc. San Pietro all'Olmo	Cornaredo	20007	€€€€	ModernCuisine,Creative	Olmo takes its name from the large elm tree that stands in the centre of Cornaredo’s small square, a symbol of the town’s pedestrianised area. This new restaurant opened by chef Davide Oldani has just three tables, which can be pushed together to accommodate a maximum of 14 guests, plus an open-view kitchen. The tasting menu here showcases the chef’s creative, modern dishes which focus on seasonal ingredients, balance and an attractive play between texture and temperature. Riccardo Merli is the young, talented resident chef who, having gained experience in renowned French restaurants as well as at Olmo, has now returned to take over the reins here. Although there is just one 6-course menu available, guests can also choose a reasonably priced 3-course option at lunchtime.
