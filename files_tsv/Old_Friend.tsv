Old Friend	via Giuseppe Cesare Abba 51	Cagliari	09126	Italy	€€	Farmtotable,SeasonalCuisine	Situated slightly away from the city’s main shopping district, this restaurant has a fresh and trendy feel with music playing in the background and friendly, efficient service in the dining room. Although the dishes change with the seasons, quality and flavour are constant throughout. Our inspector recommends the raw fish with  pico de gallo (a Mexican sauce) and bottarga or the conchiglioni pasta with mutton ragu, bechamel sauce and samphire.
