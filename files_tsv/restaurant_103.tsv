Agli Amici	via Liguria 252	Godia	33100	Italy	€€€€	Countrycooking,ModernCuisine	Serving signature cuisine, Agli Amici is one of the leading restaurants in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, a border region of diverse cultural influences that is teeming with top-quality ingredients. Many of these are showcased on the two tasting menus (one of which is vegetarian), from which guests can also choose individual dishes à la carte. Owner-chef Emanuele Scarello makes full use of the array of ingredients from the region’s pastureland, mountains and vegetable gardens, which he transforms into culinary works of art. His interesting use of Godia potatoes involves a modern reinterpretation of a local butter and sage dish using roots, apple and fermented turnips. Front of house, Michela is responsible for a young, close-knit and professional team of staff.
