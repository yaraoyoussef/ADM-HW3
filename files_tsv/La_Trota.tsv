La Trota	via Santa Susanna 33	località Piedicolle	Rivodutri	02010	€€€€	Countrycooking,Creative	Before entering this restaurant, stop for a moment to admire the crystal-clear waters of the Santa Susanna canal which runs opposite the building. La Trota has revolutionised and raised the standard of cooking freshwater fish, elevating it to the level of other produce traditionally considered to be more refined. At this restaurant, the Serva brothers, ably assisted by their respective children, showcase ingredients such as trout, tench, freshwater crayfish, pike and catfish, which are sourced from the clean waters nearby and which feature on the menu alongside a few meat dishes. They also make good use of wild herbs – guests are given an extract of these to take home, which they can use to make a warm herbal tea or a cool drink. There’s also an excellent choice of wine to accompany your meal, plus a surprising selection of cognacs and liqueurs. In fine weather, guests have the option of dining on the small wooden bridge spanning the canal. The restaurant celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2023.
