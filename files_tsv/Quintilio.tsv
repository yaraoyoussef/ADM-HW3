Quintilio	via Gramsci 23	Altare	17041	Italy	€€	Countrycooking,ModernCuisine	For over a century, and from generation to generation, Quintilio has acted as a junction between two beautiful regions, Liguria and Piedmont – and not just in a geographical sense. These regions take pride of place on the wine list (overseen by the friendly and talented owner Lorena) as well as on the menu, which is created daily with dishes made from top-quality local ingredients full of flavour. Regional specialities such as plin, Ligurian-style rabbit tortelli, risottos, vitello tonnato (veal) and brain are all skilfully reinterpreted with a modern twist by owner-chef Luca Bazzano.
