Innocenti Evasioni	via Giuseppe Candiani 66	Milan	20158	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,MediterraneanCuisine	Chef Tommaso Arrigoni’s restaurant has a wonderful new location, where floor-to-ceiling windows in the spacious modern dining room overlook a large Mediterranean garden that is just as appealing as the Zen-inspired outdoor space at his previous venue. The chef’s colourful cuisine is showcased on three tasting menus, from which dishes can also be selected à la carte. The interesting “Delle Mezze” menu allows guests to sample several small portions of different dishes.
