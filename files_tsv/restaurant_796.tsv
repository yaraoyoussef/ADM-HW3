La Saletta	via fratelli Kennedy 27/b	Alghero	07041	Italy	€€€	Sardinian,ModernCuisine	Just a stone’s throw from the seafront promenade in the historic centre of Alghero, this small gem run by Gian Luca Chessa offers the best of Sardinia. The cuisine is showcased on different tasting menus, including Rivoluzione (creative yet with a regional focus); Radici (vegetables take centre stage); Riviera (local fish); and Cortile (traditionally inspired dishes). We particularly enjoyed the gnocchi stuffed with sheep’s ricotta cheese, beetroot sauce and Sardinian scorzone truffle – a real treat! All the wines are available by the glass, so don’t hesitate to ask the sommelier for recommendations.	['Air conditioning']	['Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 079 412 5748	http://www.lasalettaalghero.com
