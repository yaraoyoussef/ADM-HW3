La Zanzara	via per Volano 52	località Porticino	Codigoro	44021	€€€	Seafood	The small room is characteristic and in the cold season the atmosphere is warmed, in every sense, by the crackling fireplace. The chef suggests all the most varied produce of the lagoon: lots of eel, prepared very simply and charcoal grilled, while the fish of the Adriatic Sea, including excellent squid and small brill, reign supreme. Reaching the farmhouse is an experience all in itself: in the valley of the Po delta, with its rich fauna and thick vegetation.
