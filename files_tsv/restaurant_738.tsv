Suinsom	strada Puez 12	Selva di Val Gardena	39048	Italy	€€€€	ItalianContemporary	The two small pale wood paneled stube are the stage for a gourmet cuisine with a Mediterranean touch and more besides, the charcoal-grilled eel is a striking example, besides being delicious. Among the excellent meats, we recommend the roe deer venison, tender with a rich flavor thanks to its preparation that includes mango, while the Tuscan chef draws on his origins for some first courses, such as pici with lamb ragout and cuttlefish tartar... a truly interesting suggestion! The good wine selection includes various and even international productions on a wine list that is well divided by vine variety.
