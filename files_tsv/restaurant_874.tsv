iPalici	via Antonello da Messina 3	Viagrande	95029	Italy	€€€	Sicilian,Contemporary	Situated behind Acireale at the foot of Mount Etna National Park, this restaurant is located within the Relais San Giuliano. Deceptively uninteresting from the outside, this historic building and its inner courtyards boast a charm and grandeur that will take your breath away. A huge 16C wine press provides the backdrop for fine cuisine that is more than equal to its impressive setting. Here, the menu makes full use of vegetables and other Sicilian ingredients in dishes that are influenced by the island’s culinary traditions yet reinterpreted with a skilful contemporary twist by the chef.
