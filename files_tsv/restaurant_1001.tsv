Tubladel	via Trebinger 22	Ortisei	39046	Italy	€€€	RegionalCuisine	Although this restaurant with wood-adorned dining rooms has the rustic and romantic ambience of an old Alpine hut (the name “tubladel” is the Ladin for hay barn), it is actually situated just a stone’s throw from the centre of Ortisei. The cuisine focuses on local ingredients such as meat and game, with dishes such as venison pappardelle and roast pork shank on the menu, and very few fish options. Good selection of wines by the glass.	Car park, Terrace	Mastercard, Visa	+39 0471 796879	https://www.tubladel.com/
