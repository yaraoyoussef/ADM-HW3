Kohaku	via Marche 66	Rome	00187	Italy	€€	JapaneseContemporary	As if by magic, once you step over the threshold at this restaurant you feel as though you are in Japan, thanks to the soft music, elegant ambience and stylish decor. Japanese Kaiseki dishes take pride of place here, all made from seasonal ingredients with a real respect for integrity. We particularly enjoyed the duck with miso cooked at low heat for eight hours. An interesting sake selection and a lighter menu at lunchtime add to the appeal.	['Notable sake list']	['Amex', 'Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 06 4566 5202	https://www.kohakurome.com/
