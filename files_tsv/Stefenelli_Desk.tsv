Stefenelli Desk	via Claude d'Avise 14	Aosta	11100	Italy	€€	CuisinefromtheAostaValley,Creative	This restaurant is situated in an alleyway in the historic centre of Aoste. Full of character and accessed via a staircase from the entrance hall, the dining room is housed in what were probably the palazzo’s 18C stables. Under a brick-vaulted ceiling and arches, enjoy cuisine from the Aosta valley with a creative twist.
