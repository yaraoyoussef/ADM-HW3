Bramea	viale Villa d'Errico 10	Palazzo San Gervasio	85026	Italy	€€	Creative	This gourmet restaurant with just a few tables is run by two young friends, now business partners at Bramea, with one at the helm in the kitchen, the other front of house. Extensive tasting menus are the focus here, featuring creative and original dishes often made from local ingredients. The end result is fascinating and of the highest quality.
