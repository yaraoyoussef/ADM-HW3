Caffè La Crepa	piazza Matteotti 14	Isola Dovarese	26031	Italy	€€	Lombardian	Overlooking a picturesque Renaissance square, the café here dates back to the early 19C and the trattoria shortly after. Today, the decor is a nostalgic mix of styles from the mid-19C to the mid-20c, including Art Nouveau. The restaurant not only appeals to the eyes but also to the tastebuds, thanks to its expertly prepared traditional dishes made from carefully chosen top-quality ingredients which are full of flavour. And if you’d like to take a souvenir home with you, there’s also a shop here selling food specialities and wine.
