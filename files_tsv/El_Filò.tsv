El Filò	strada Dolomites 103	Pozza di Fassa	38036	Italy	€€€	RegionalCuisine,ClassicCuisine	Following recent refurbishment, El Filò is now even more comfortable than ever, boasting an Alpine-influenced decor that is striking for its contemporary style. The Dolomites and Ladin culinary traditions are still very much to the fore in the cuisine, which is prepared by the excellent owner-chef, although modern touches and influences from outside the region also feature. The wine list offers a fine selection of options from the region.	['Car park']	['Mastercard', 'Visa']	+39 0462 763210	http://www.el-filo.com
