Casa Sgarra	lungomare C. Colombo 114	Trani	76125	Italy	€€€	Apulian,Creative	Three brothers (two front of house and one in the kitchen) offer a friendly welcome at this modern, elegant restaurant on the seafront at Trani, just a 20min walk from the town’s picturesque port. Although the menu also features dishes from other parts of Italy (especially Piedmont), on the whole the cuisine here is typical of Puglia, featuring local ingredients such a broad beans, almonds from Toritto, burrata and ricotta cheese, truffles and black chickpeas from Murgia, “grano arso” flour and, of course, the region’s excellent olive oils. The friendly, welcoming feel of the restaurant is summed up in the slogan that the three brothers have chosen for their restaurant – “a family story”. And, we would add, a story of fine cuisine!
